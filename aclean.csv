0,1997,"""King Lear"" Through Film: Brook and Kozintsev",Alexandra Parsons,Yu Jin Ko,"The final scene of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" provides a multitude of interpretive possibilities, while film offers a unique medium that is open to diverse interpretations and emphases. Peter Brook's film ""King Lear"" (1970) unwaveringly depicts man's meaningless struggle with an unforgiving universe; rather than affirming life, Brook's vision of Lear's world is dark and cold. By contrast, the denouement of Grigori Kozintsev's ""Korol Lir"" (1970) ultimately leaves the viewer with a feeling of redemption and renewal in a universe that is not entirely devoid of love and compassion, and in which much of humanity shares a common bond through the affirmation of life. These differences notwithstanding, each production is a legitimate interpretation that realizes one of the myriad performative possibilities inherent in a rich and flexible theatrical work.

1,1997,The Grotesque Nature of Paradise in Milton's Paradise Lost,Elizabeth Reich,Jody Mikalachki,"In The Interpretacion of Dreams Freud writes that when dreamers attempt to draw the landscapes in their dreams, they prove to represent ""the human body, the genitals, etc., and only then do the dreams become intelligible."" If one attempts to construct a diagram based on Milton's description of the Mount of Paradise in Book IV of Paradise Lost, one is confronted with a representation of the female genitalia. Milton's diction and imagery point clearly in this direction: ""rural mound,"" ""enclosure green,"" ""champaign head,"" and ultimately, ""hairy sides."" In fact, II his descriptive metaphors actually anticipate Freud's clinical practice in their reliance on a discourse of drawing, mapping, and artistic representation: the grotesque, theaters, and ""lantskips"" are all included in Milton's representation of Paradise. My presentation will use Freud as a point of departure to focus on the connections between Milton's sexualized topography of Paradise and his reliance on artistic metaphors, especially the grotesque, to suggest the subversive potential of that landscape.",1997,Unspecified,English
2,1997,"Eliminating Stereotypes, Identifying Confounding Social Variables",Aimee Jabro-Young,Paul Wink,"This study compared differences in political behavior and attitudes among over 200 Chinese-American and Euro-American students at the University of California at Berkeley. Preliminary analyses revealed that Chinese-American students rated themselves as Jess politically active, less knowledgeable about political events in the United States. and less involved in political campus activities than Euro-American students. These differences disappeared, however, once length of residence in the United States and other social variables were controlled . In addition, Chinese-American students described their parents as less politically involved and as playing a less active role in transmitting political values to their children. These differences between ChineseAmerican and Euro-American students persisted after controlling for social variables other than ethnicity. The meaning of these findings for political behavior among Chinese-Americans will be discussed.",1998,Unspecified,Psychology
3,1997,The Art of Hatred: The Representation of Jewish and Irish Immigrants in Nineteenth-Century American Political Cartoons,Inna Kantor,Frances Malino,"During much of the nineteenth century. European immigrants to the United States served as subject matter for political cartoonists and caricaturists. The generally antagonistic climate of the times gave rise to a number of caricaturists who depicted the foreigner on American soil in pejorative terms. The foreigner soon became the flag of 10 corruption, flying high for all to see in the magazines. periodicals and newspapers of the time. Since cartoons represent collaborations between the artists' personal beliefs and those of their audience, the political cartoons of nineteenth-century America were not seen merely as isolated examples of anti-Jewish and anti-Irish sentiments, but as representations of the prevailing disposition of Americans towards Jewish and Irish immigrants. The ridicule of immigrants in political cartoons suggests an American attempt to subdue and thus to make inferior those who, in reality, were feared.",1997,Unspecified,Jewish Studies

I have focused on several critical junctures in NonvegianJewish history: the time period surrounding the adoption of the Nonvegian constitution, the World War II era. and the contemporary period. I will also contrast the status of Norwegian Jews to that of American Jews, in order to illuminate the particular difficulties involved in asserting minority identity within an ultra-homogenous society.",1997,Unspecified,Religion

6,1997,Elements of Shamanism in an Altaic Earth-Diver Creation Myth,Elizabeth Boatright,Stephen Marini,"This exegetical study of an Earth-Diver creation myth of the Altai of Southern Siberia will suggest how the metaphors of the creation myth shed light on the practices of the Altaic shaman. The successful discovery and subsequent translation of this creation myth, taken from a nineteenthcentury text (unavailable in English), illustrate how later variants of the Altaic cosmogony understate the influence of shamanism. This presentation will examine the richly diverse social and religious structure of the Altai, as well as other texts from their oral tradition involving shamanist elements. In addition, a critique of Mircea Eliade's non-reductionist theories of ""archaic"" peoples and the prestige of the cosmogony will be offered. The myth chosen for this intensive study will be provided to the aud ience, as it is a revolutionary text that illuminates the practice of shamanism in the Altaic society perhaps more than the creation of the world itself.",1997,Unspecified,Religion

8,1997,The Presences of Nair Women in the Political and Literary World,"Kavitha Nair, Vandana Radhakrishnan",Jody Mikalachki,"The focal point of this presentation is the Nair community in the South Indian state of Kerala. The Nair community practiced a system of matrilineal living and inheritance until the system's dissolution by the British in 1810. This talk will include a discussion of gender as a source of empowerment for Nair women, sexual freedom in the Nair community, especially for Nair women, and the legacy of matrilineage for today's women in Kerala. Kavitha Nair will consider Milton's depiction (in Paradise Lost) of Nair women as the symbol of sexuality in a fallen world, and will also offer evidence that Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley's views on free love were influenced by the Nair matrilineal system. Vandana Radhakrishnan will discuss the political nature of the Nair community and the matrilineal system, the role of British colonial law in changing Indian conceptions of the Nair, and the culture of Nair women and its meaning for feminine, social, and political development in Kerala. Finally, she will speculate on whether Kerala's model of development for women can be replicated in other parts of India.","1999, 1999",Unspecified,English
9,1997,Child-Parent Relationships Among Chinese-Americans: Does Confucianism Matter?,Gloria Chyou,Paul Wink,"This study reports on differences in self-descriptions of child-parent relations among a group of over 200 Chinese-American and Euro-American students at the University of California, Berkeley. Chinese-American students tended to describe themselves as less independent of their parents and to depict their family structure as more hierarchical than did Euro-American students. I lowever, the differences in autonomy between the two groups were no longer significant after the family's socioeconomic status and generation (the participants' distance in descent from the point of immigration into the United States) were controlled. A greater emphasis on hierarchical family relations persisted among the Chinese-American participants, however, even after group differences on other social variables were controlled. The influence of Confucianism on family relations among Chinese-Americans will also be discussed.",1998,Unspecified,Psychology
10,1997,Unity and Diversity Among American Muslims,Asma Gull Hasan,Louise Marlow,"Islam emphasizes the inherent equality of all Muslims before God, yet Islamic societies, like all societies, naturally face social tensions. Distinguishing American Muslims from world Muslims is their diversity. In addition to being ethnically diverse, the over five million American Muslims from roughly 65 different ethnic origins are also diverse in their opinions, in the amount of time they have lived in the United States, and in many other matters. In the United States, Muslims face the challenge and ideal of Islamic egalitarianism as no other Muslims have. Are American Muslims working together? How do American ideas of egaUtarianism influence American Islam? I will explore these questions as they relate to American Muslim involvement in American politics, in social issues such as education and women's rights, and in the media. Islam has always celebrated itself as a colorless and raceless religion; I will discuss how that proposition is tested - and often proven - in the United States.",1997,Unspecified,Religion
11,1997,A Neo-Confucian Analysis of Contemporary China,Catherine Hudak,James Kodera,"Neo-Confucian philosophers such as Chu Hsi postulated that the individual self and the society surrounding it are of equal importance and that a true balance between the desires and demands of the two must be met. This idea, founded in the belief that such a balance is possible, stands in sharp contrast to the conflict between self and society in contemporary China. During the ideological Mao era, society overcame the individual, while, in the more pragmatic Deng era, the demands of the individual are overwhelming the needs of society. In both cases, the problems created by social imbalance are dangerous to all. Using a Neo-Confucian lens that emphasizes the importance of balancing the singular with the plural, I will examine recent Chinese history and will discuss the merits of reaching back into history for solutions to current problems.",1997,Unspecified,Religion
12,1997,What is American Transcendentalism?,Amy Kruetzman,Michael Cooper,"What is American Thanscendentalism? Is it a literary movement, a philosophical revolution, a means to activism? What constitutes this primarily New England phenomenon that pervades nineteenth-century literature, politics, and even art? Why are its limits so difficult to define, its doctrine often so elusive that it becomes a task simply to understand it? Is this enigmatic philosophy merely living up to its name in its refusal to be defined? Through studying the private and public works of leading Transcendentalist thinkers - Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Margaret Fuller, and Amos Bronson Alcott - I will investigate what American Transcendentalism was at its inception and explore the extent to which the primary thinkers of the movement were true to their philosophy in daily life. Let us ""get to the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give a true account of it"" (Thoreau).",1997,Unspecified,English
13,1997,Economy of Words: A Woman's Route to Power in Pride and Prejudice,Alina Kantor,Susan Meyer,"In Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen explores the dynamics of power in late eighteenthcentury society. Suggesting that there is a direct link between economic status and power, she defines power as the ability to govern oneself, to make one's own decisions, and to control one's choices. Elizabeth Bennet notes that Mr. Darcy has ""great power in the power of choice ... the power of doing what he likes,"" and Colonel Fitzwilliam adds that Darcy ""has better means of having"" power ""than many others, because he is rich."" Wealth feeds Darcy's power, but is Austen implying that there are no other means to enjoy the power of choice? Although capital appears to be a dominant factor in determining one's position and authority in society, Austen suggests that the ability to manipulate and to control one's modes of self-expression is essential in maintaining a powerful position in society.",1997,Unspecified,English
14,1997,The Female Patriarch: Mademoiselle Reisz's Role in Denying Female Liberation in The Awakening,lnna Kantor,William Cain,"Kate Chopin's The Awakening explores various options for the emancipation of women. Mlle. Reisz, an outcast from established society, escapes her prescribed feminine role and is thereby free to pursue her professional desires. Possessing male traits, she attracts Edna Pontellier, who feels constrained by her own position and views Mlle. Reisz's masculine behavior as a means of liberation from the societal sphere of women. Yet the relationship of Mlle. Reisz and Edna assumes a male-female dynamic, which forces Edna to assume a subordinate position that corresponds to the societal status she is attempting to reject. Through Edna's disenchantment with Mlle. Reisz, Chopin suggests that since communities tend to institute a hierarchy in which feminine qualities guarantee an inferior position, the notion that a woman might find liberation within the company of other women ultimately proves impossible.",1997,Unspecified,English
15,1997,"The Female Author/ Arranger and the Myth of the ""Comfortable Home"" in Wilkie Collins's Armadale",Christina J. Kastros,Barbara Harman,"Wilkie Collins, the friend and collaborator of Charles Dickens, was a best-selli ng Victorian writer mainly known for his ""sensation novels,"" in which murder, bigamy, and illegitimacy occur within middle- and upperclass English homes. Underneath their sensational surfaces, his novels highlight characteristic Victorian anxieties regarding domesticity and the security of the home. In Armadale (1866). Collins presents characters and readers alike with a maze of disordered houses. His fascinating anti-heroine Lydia Gwilt, who has been tried for murder and imprisoned for robbery, operates as an alternative author-figure in the novel; she undermines security by engineering a murderous vision of ""ordered"" domestic space in the extraordinary sanatorium in which the novel's final scenes transpire. Collins ultimately suggests that we are not ""fools . . . to leave our comfortable homes,"" as one of his characters declares, bul rather fools for believing in the myth of domestic security.",1997,Unspecified,English
16,1997,Playing the Virago: Cross-Dressing Women in the Renaissance,Sarah Wall,Yu Jin Ko,"Mary Frith (1584-1659?), also known as Moll or Mal Cutpurse, was a seventeenth-century London woman who dressed and to some degree lived as a man. She was also the most famous transvestite of her time. Orphaned in youth, Frith became a celebrated figure of the underworld, known as a pickpocket and/or madam. The subject of a modest literary subgenre, she appears in two extant plays, Middleton's and Dekker's  ""The Roaring Girl,"" and Nathaniel Field's 1618 ""Amends for Ladies,"" and in a 1662 ""autobiography,"" The Life and Death of Mrs Mary Frith, Commonly Called Mal Cutpurse.

A reaction intermediate is a product of one elementary step and a reactant in a subsequent elementary step of a multistep reaction mechanism. Often reaction intermediates are very labile species, making them difficult to study using experimental tools. For this particular reaction, however, the benzyne intermediate has recently been isolated, providing a basis for comparison between experimental results and theoretical calculations. Graphical tools will be used to demonstrate the geometrical, electronic, and vibrational properties of benzyne. Theoretical studies such as these may yield better mechanistic models of chemical reactions, a major goal of chemistry throughout its development.",1997,Unspecified,Chemistry

Bontrager,Kaye Peterman,"Root hair development is a complex phenomenon involving such processes as cell fate determination, cell differentialion, and tip grow1h. The lipoxygenase inhibitor phenidone results in a dose-dependent suppression of ro01 hair development in Arabidopsis. The goal of this research is to determine 1he stage in the developmental pathway at which phenidone acts. Seeds were grown on vertically placed solid agar plates, and the plants were examined after four days of growth. Phenidone-treated seedlings consistently showed shorter root and root hair lengths than did the controls. The shon hair lengths suggest that phenidone inhibits lip growth in hair cells. AJthough it appeared initially that root hair number was also reduced in the presence of phenidone, new microscopic techniques indicated that this may not be the case. Confirmation that root hair number is not affected by phenidone would provide evidence that the inhibitor does not interfere with root hair initialion. The effect of phenidone on the position of root hair formation with respect to the underlying conical cells will be determined. In addition, the hypothesis that phenidone inhibits tip growth will be tested directly by measuring root hair growth rates using time-lapsed microscopy.",1997,Unspecified,Biological Sciences
33,1997,Adjustable Allocation: A Strategy for Maximizing Reproductive Success in Clarkia gracilis,Erica A. Kruger,Kristina Jones,"Maximizing reproductive success requires efficient use of energy and nutrients on the part of a plant. Resources must be utilized for the production of pollinator-a!lfaction charactersitics (e.g., large, showy petals), as well as for reproduction activities (e.g., maturation of seeds and fruits). One strategy for maximizing fitness could involve a shift in relative allocation of resources from pollinator-attraclion (for early flowers) to reproduction (for later flowers), over the blooming season of an individual plant. This study introduces the exciting possibility that plants can actively alter the relative proportions of resources utilized for attraction and reproduction functions. Evidence of this pattern was noted in 1he annual Clarkia gracilis in a previous field study. At the present time, I am testing whether this plant can adjust the timing of such a resource shirt, given differing pollination success of early flowers. Preliminary observations suggest that pollination of early Clarkia flowers may affect such pollinator-attraction charactersitics as floral longevity and petal length of later-blooming flowers within an individual plant.",1997,Unspecified,Biological Sciences

The resources used to produce petal tissue and to maintain the flower on the pedicle (longevity) represent energy that could alternatively be used to develop more ovaries and nourish increased numbers of seeds. Flowers have two roles: advertising and reproducing. The relative amount of energy spent on both expenses, however, changes over the lifetime of a flower. To maximize efficiency, one strategy would be to continue allocating energy for advertising until pollination, but then to transfer resources to reproduction after - and only after - pollination. This project addresses the hypothesis that snapdragon plants can respond to pollination by changing the distribution of resources from advertising to reproduction.",1998,Unspecified,Biological Sciences

They are composed or three pigmented phycobiliproteins held together by linker peptides, and they serve b01h as accessory pigments and as nitrogen storage. Phycobilisome isolation was performed from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6308 in order to elucidate intact phycobilisome structure, and to allow comparison of phycobilisomes isolated from cyanobacteria grown under various environmental and nutritionaJ stresses. By attempting isolation under variable conditions, it was shown that phycobilisomes best maintain their integrity when isolated under a modification of Gantt's conditions. After preliminary phycobilisome isolation by slight variations of Gantt's protocol, extracts were subjected to centrifugation at 199,000xg for various time intervals, and the resulting pellets were resuspended. One-tenth dilutions of whole phycobilisomes and heavily dilu ted samples of the pellets were subjected to negative staining. Samples were then observed and photographed using transmission electron microscopy. The structure of the phycobilisomes obtained represents an improvement over phycobilisomes isolated in this lab in the past, aJiowing for further research into the effect of environmental stress on the morphology and metabolism of cyanobacteria.",1998,Unspecified,Biological Sciences

It was designed as a possible antitumor and antiviral agent. If the analog behaves as anticipated, it will be phosphorylated by adenosine kinase in tumor or viral cells, and as a result, become a toxic nucleoside. Since the direct ribosidation of the triazolo triazole base produced the N-1 ribosidated analog, several new synthetic schemes have been proposed 10 achieve the ribosidation at N-7. One of the synthetic schemes is to ribosidate 3-hydrazino-1 ,2,4-triazole hyrochloride, the precursor of the base, after the protection of its exocyclic amine.

38,1997,The Synthesis of 100% Anti Adenosine Analogs,Rebecca Landsberg,David Haines,"Adenosine and its analogs exist in an equilibrium between syn and anti conformations. To be able to predict on which side of the equilibrium a given nucleoside lies, it is necessary to create a known syn and a known anti analog of adenosine. 100% syn and 100% anti analogs can be analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and used as models to predict the side of the anti-syn equilibrium on which a given analog lies. Currenently I am attempting the synthesis of 8,5'-anhydro-8-oxoadenosine, which is the anti analog. The synthesis has been performed in three steps, with the last step being the most difficult. Previous attempts have employed a reagent (hydrochloric acid) that can cause panial degradation of the molecule. This past semester I have tried using a different reagent, boron trichloride. Analysis of the product of this reaction is currently under way. An alternative five-step method of synthesis is also being designed.",1997,Unspecified,Chemistry

Molleur,Jean Stanley,"Although many organosilicon compounds have been shown to have important biological activities, the bonding characteristics and their modes of operation are not fully understood. There is considerable evidence that in certain bonds to silicon, notably from oxygen, nitrogen and fluorine, there is some double bond character, probably due to (d-p)pi backbonding. It has been hypothesized that in lhe case of methylsilanes, the d-orbitals of the silicon gain electron density by overlapping wilh the C-H bonds of the methyl groups. This mechanism is known as hyperconjugation. The extent of alkyl group involvement is dependent on angular orientations, orbital symmetry, and the nature of the alkyl groups. We will report 29Si NMR chemical shifts and coupling constants for diisopropylsilanes of type: (CH3)2CHSiHX, X =(Group A): F, Cl, OR. NR2, (Group B): CF3, COR, COCF3. These NMR data will be correlated with the electronegativity of lhe substituents. In Group A, the substituents are capable of back-bonding, while in Group 8 this possibility has been minimized.

By inhibiting Inosine Monophosphate Dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in de novo purine biosynthesis, the analog may offer anti-viral and anti-tumor effects. Studies to date have shown the exocyclic nitrogen of aminomethyl-1 ,2,4- triazole, a successfully synthesized intermediate to the target compound, to be the most nucleophilic in attempts at ribosidation. Generation of the phthaloylated protected triazole renders the exocyclic nitrogen virtually unreactive, ensuring ribosidation on the triazole ring system.

A program for collection 1 H- 13C NOE data on the Bruker 200 MHz NMR spectrometer was developed and refined. Our methodology for studying conformation includes the use of know inte rnuclear distances to ascertain unknown distances within the molecule. Internuclear distances have been experimentally established through observation of nuclear relaxation phenomena. Internuclear distances from protons in the ribose moiety to carbon atoms in the purine base serve as probes for glycosidic conformation. Nucleosides of restricted conformations have been analyzed to develop a quantitative model that relates NOE to glycosidic conformation in solution.,1997,Unspecified,Chemistry

44,1997,The Uses of Polymer Gels,Dahlene Fusco,Kinwai Singh,"Polymer gels have been developed that can detect and identify metal ions in solution. These gels undergo a phase transition when they reach critical temperature. When a charged gel is exposed to metal ions, the critical temperature of the gel changes. With an understanding of how gel transition temperature is related to metal ion presence, it should be possible to identify ions in solution using a gel sensor. Such a sensor, called a chromatograph, will undergo a change in critical temperature upon exposure to ions. As the ions diffuse through the gel, the resulting ionic distribution will be reflected in a distribution of transition temperatures across the chromatograph. A monitor will measure the transition temperature profile of different parts of the gel as a function of time. This profile will be compared to a theoretical model of ionic effect on critical temperature and the ions in solution will be identified.",1997,Unspecified,Physics

In the past, attachment has been approached both from behavioral and cognitive perspectives, including infant responses to separations from parents and adult romantic relationships. One aspect of attachment that has not been studied extensively, however, involves the role that it plays in the construction of autobiographical memory. A questionnaire that assesses both adult attachment status and memory for early childhood events was administered to 100 Wellesley College students. Participants were assigned to one of four attachment categories (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, or fearful). The attachment groups were expected to differ with respect to the age and the degree of specificity of the reported memories; securely attached adults should report earlier and more specific memories than their insecurely attached peers. The relationship between attachment status and memory should be strongest when participants are asked to provide memories that focus directly on early relationships with parents.",1997,Unspecified,Psychology

This study applies the theory of multiple roles to traditionally-aged college women and will assess the ten roles of student, daughter, friend, partner, worker, sister, extracurricular member, athlete, volunteer, and roommate in 100 students from an all-women's college. The relationships between mental health (in terms of psychological distress and general wellbeing) and role occupancy, role quality, and the level of involvement in each role will be examined. Role quality is hypothesized as being most predictive of both measures of mental health. Moreover, the relationship between role quality and one's reported mental health is believed to be influenced both by the level of perceived social support and by one's employed coping strategy in managing multiple domains in life.

A moral panic occurs when the representation of and public reaction to threat is disproponionate to the empirical phenomenon. The spectre of an increasingly large population of unproductive citizens is presented in the media as a moral and economic threat to the health and stability of the nation. This threat is constructed in such a way as to locate it in a definable sector of society, namely the black underclass, despite statistical evidence that indicates otherwise. Media coverage of the welfare debate exaggerates the facts: how many persons are on welfare, what proportion of the national budget is devoted to welfare, how many of the recipients stay on welfare for their entire lives.

I propose that because such workers place a far higher premium on interpersonal relationships than do workers in other sectors, they are more easily frustrated by the conflicts inherent in all organizations. A significant portion of social service workers' job satisfaction is tied to successful, unproblematic relationships with their clients and co-workers, whereas workers in other sectors find a greater portion of their job salisfaction in wages and upward career mobility.

Although the legitimacy of the prison system is seldom challenged, the question of the legitimacy of private prison companies, which have emerged in the last twenty years, inspires debate. Much of this debate has centered around the purposes private prisons serve, with the assumption that these will differ from the purposes the public prisons serve. As companies designed to provide a service for a profit, private prisons have an interest in creating a new supply of prisoners, and detaining the presem supply in order to fiU the space. Viewing architecture as a concrete representation of the purpose of a prison. this presentation examines how modem private prisons differ in design from public prisons built during the same time.

If BWS is eventually accepted as a legitimate defense, what are the implications for individual cases and the larger society? As society acknowledges the collective harm, where will the legal system locate responsibility: in the individual women who take action to protect themselves or with the criminal justice system that has failed to defend abused women? As BWS becomes a more common defense, the logic has been expanded into other areas, such as Battered Children's Syndrome and Black Male Rage. Does this appropriation diminish the claims of women victims? Or. docs a criminal defense of BWS victimize the women twice, first by the batterer and then by the patriarchal legal system?

Instead of serving time in jail, or paying financial penalties, some convicted felons have been asked to keep large billboards on their property warning passersby that a thief lives there; others have been required to stand before their victims, announce their guilt, and ask how they might make amends. Rather than separate the criminal defendant from the world - both metaphorically and physically - the shaming process insists that defendants remain connected to the persons and situations that their crimes disrupted and injured.

71,1997,Enhancing Variability Detection Through Atypical Social Group Exemplars,Susan Archambault,Nancy Genero,"The purpose of this study is to reduce stereotypic thinking by teaching individuals to recognize the variability of group characteristics (""They are not all alike""). By manipulating visual images of an artistic social group (poets), we will auempt to foster more mindful judgments about other social groups in an unobtrusive way. Subjects will be randomly assigned to view either a set of traditional, homogenous images of poets or a set of both traditional and non-traditional images of poets. After exposure to the visual stimuli, subjects will learn about a fictitious community called the Akamba, and make judgments about individual cases based on what they learn. It is expected that subjects who view heterogeneous images will make mindful, nonstereotypic judgments. By contrast, narrow and stereotypic judgments are expected from subjects who view homogeneous images. The ability to prime individuals to think in a non-stereotypic way suggests a cognitive basis for diversity training.",1997,Unspecified,Psychology

Published in 1894, Marcella is a political romance that was a blockbuster novel. The novel explores the complex relationship between self-government and personal integrity. Marcella, the future heiress of Mellor Park, must reconcile her selfish ambition for social recognition with her more altruistic goals of social philanthropy. Her public activity, her London nursing, and her social experiments suggest that she belongs to a tradition of tremendously independent female heroines. However, this reading is complicated by Marcella's eventual marriage to the Parliamentarian Aldous Raeburn and her diminution of agency at the conclusion of the novel. Marcella's problematic feminism seem reflective of Mrs. Ward's own conflicted feelings about feminism.

In Manchester, Mrs. Leigh of Lizzie Leigh creates her own interpretation of God's mercy in order to reclaim her fallen daughter in a striking reaction to male authority. The city allows for a progressive sense of female independence and, in the novels Mary Barton and North and South, an unconventional access to the public realm. In the urban setting, women's private, emotional needs are set against potentially dangerous threats such as isolation and seduction. The countryside, by contrast, allows for a heavenly escape from emotional and physical urban dangers, but the escape is merely an excursion and thus transitory at best. Within the earthly reality of the city, friendships between women create a vital source of human connection and communication in Gaskell's fiction. Throughout these works, Gaskell argues for a progressive female activity that daringly counters Victorian social norms. ",1998,English and French,English

The killer whale is exceptional because of the characteristics which arise from social benefit: minimal intraspecific aggression, lack of territoriality, family groups with high inclusive fitness increasing group cohesion, low dispersal among groups, and promiscuous mating. To test the hypothesis, I used a cost-benefit analysis, i.e., is the presence of social benefit or the absence of costs associated with predation or resource limitation most influential for killer whale populations? I used a simulation modeling approach to assess costs and benefits in terms of their effects on population growth.

Many ecclesiastical writings dwelt on this topic, but none in as much detail as the Irish penitentials. These handbooks, written as guides for priests hearing confession, enumerated every conceivable carnal sin, and suggested appropriate penances, providing a glimpse of early medieval attitudes towards sexual activity. The purpose of penance was to cure sin by replacing it with purity. Although early medieval Christians considered any lustful act to be sinful, the penances varied in their severity. Why were some acts considered more sinful than others, and how were the assigned penances supposed to cure the sinner? ",1998,History,History

The earliest references place him in a religious context, and it is not until the first century B.C. that the details of his myth survive. Possessing both male and female sexual characteristics, much of his iconography in art is drawn from Aphrodite, and representations have been found in a number of different media and archaeological contexts. While the number of Greek inscriptions and representations of Hermaphroditos are limited, during the Roman period his popularity explodes. He is the subject of a number of wall paintings from Pompeii, and even table legs onto which he is carved have been found in houses. On a fundamental level, these representations all seem to have a talismanic function, although the presence of Hermaphroditos in the decorative arts seems to suggest a more complicated function for this complex character.",1998,Classical and Near Eastern Archaeology,Art

Observations collected by Professor Beth Hennessey in a fourth grade classroom were coded and analyzed. The classroom teacher supported student learning through praise and positive reinforcement, and also used a technique called modeling. Throughout the day, she highlighted examples of desirable classroom behavior to positively reinforce students and demonstrate to the rest of the class what was expected. Few studies have examined modeling techniques. Instead, research has focused on the ""hidden costs of reward."" In other words, tangible reward (including verbal praise) can often serve to decrease student motivation and hinder performance. A review of the research on intrinsic motivation and the effects of rewards reveals that modeling may be an effective technique that can be used by teachers to encourage student learning and appropriate classroom behavior without decreasing intrinsic motivation.

The relative change in light intensity acts as the cue that initiates this daily migration. Some animals are extremely sensitive to light levels and avoid complete migration in full moonlight. It was predicted that urban light pollution would decrease the amplitude and magnitude of zooplankton vertical migration in urban lakes. Black and clear plastic, cylindrical enclosures were deployed vertically in the water column within a half hour of sunset in Lake Waban, a suburban lake near Boston. Zooplankton within the enclosures and at open lake sites were sampled at three depths. The migration of Daphnia retrocurva was significantly greater in amplitude and magnitude in the black enclosures than in the clear and lake treatments. The results supported the hypothesis that urban light pollution is sufficient to inhibit diel vertical migration of zooplankton.

The exchange acidity and base saturation of soils collected along an irrigation gradient were measured to determine the effects of wastewater irrigation on cation exchange capacity (CEC). As a simple measure of soil quality, CEC is the sum of soil exchange acidity and base saturation. In general, CEC of the soil decreased with irrigation. With increasing distance from the spray head, the pH and exchange acidity of the soil increased, while base saturation decreased. High concentrations of base cations such as NA+ and Mg2 in the wastewater caused an increase in soil base saturation close to the spray head. Protons forced off soil exchange sites complexed with N03 and leached from the system, and this loss of protons caused an elevation in the pH of soils receiving high wastewater inputs.",1999,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

The cells grown in the different media were broken in two different buffers, HEPES (50 mM, pH = 8) and PIPES (50 mM, pH = 6). PIPES buffer was found previously to keep the cytoplasmic membrane more intact for localization studies than HEPES buffer. Enzyme activity in HEPES and PIPES buffers needed to be determined before further localization studies. Exopolyphosphatase activity in HEPES buffer was greater than that in PIPES buffer for cells grown in medium 2. PIPES buffer showed enzyme activity for the cells grown in media 3, whereas the product in HEPES buffer did not give stable spectrophotometric readings.

Women, in particular, are influenced by family and social factors. The number of children, ages of these children, marital status and spousal income will likely change the number of hours she commits to the workplace. Regression analysis allows economists to study how each of these individual variables will change women's weekly labor hours. The software program, RATS (Regression Analysis Time Series), allows the researcher to study sub-groups. Thus certain types of women could be compared to each other: ""married, college-educated women"" or ""unmarried, educated women with children"" and other conceivable sub-groups. For example, we find that single women will increase their hours more than married women if they obtain a college degree. ",1999,Economics and Psychology,Economics
140,1998,The Role of Fashion Advertisement in Dictating the Ideal Body Image of Women and Men,"Zoe Stinchfield, Psychology '98 "," Linda Carli, Psychology ","This presentation examines the change in the ideal body image of women and men in fashion magazines, as represented in the chest-to-waist and waist-to-hip ratios of male and female models in fashion magazines during 1980-1995. Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia have been increasing over the last several decades, and it is thought that socio-cultural factors are responsible for this pattern. I hypothesized that the chest-to-waist ratios of men and women would begin to decrease while their waist-to-hip ratios would begin to increase. This would demonstrate a trend toward a ""tubular"" and androgynous body shape. My hypothesis was confirmed, and I suggest that this ideal body image is a difficult and unrealistic body type to achieve. These results support the conclusion that the media, especially fashion advertisements, are correlated with the increase in eating disorders for both men and women. ",1998,Psychology,Psychology

Coyne, Biological Sciences ","Core body temperature (CBT) is a summation of two rhythms that alter a set-point in the hypothalamus of the brain. Cutaneous blood flow adjusts the CBT to its new 'set-point' by heat gain or loss. We investigated the changes of this blood flow over 24-hour (circadian rhythm) and 28-day menstrual periods (monthly rhythm). We found that there was an increase in skin temperature, i.e. blood flow, in the hands (distal) and a decrease in heart rate at night compared to daytime, suggesting a decreased sympathetic tone. However, skin temperature in the torso (proximal) decreased, suggesting there may be competing controls on skin blood flow in the proximal versus distal areas. We hypothesize that the hormone, melatonin, released nocturnally, may act directly on proximal blood vessels to cause vasoconstriction. We are investigating whether the reproductive hormones further modify the circadian rhythms of cutaneous blood flow during the menstrual cycle.",1998,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

Very few research studies have focused on South Asian women in the U.S. in general and there appear to be no published studies that address body image in particular. It is important to study South Asian women as an individual group because research conducted on East Asian populations (e.g., Chinese, Japanese) has found results unique to each culture. It will be interesting to see whether within the South Asian population there are correlations between higher or lower acculturation and body proportion dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, height and body weight satisfaction, bulimic behaviors, concern over mistakes, personal standards, perfectionism, and internalization of societal norms.",1998,Psychology,Psychology

Similarly, social interaction theory of autobiographical memory formation places parent-child co-construction of narratives as central. While attachment theory has been looked at extensively with respect to infant-parent separation, as well as adult parental and romantic roles, little has been done relating attachment status and the construction of autobiographical memory. A questionnaire has been administered to 100 Wellesley College students, assessing both attachment status and memory for early childhood events. Participants will be placed in one of four adult attachment categories (secure, dismissing, preoccupied, or fearful), and analyses will determine whether adult attachment status is predictive of the affective content of early childhood memories, age at the time of the remembered experiences, and whether the experiences were talked about with a parent at the time.

Mice performed spatial, spatial reversal, and cued navigation tasks in the Morris water maze to examine non-spatial and spatial reference memory, and were run in an odor discrimination task to test non-spatial reference and working memory. Basic reflexes, anxiety in a plus maze, and locomotor activity were also measured. The results show that aged mice are impaired relative to young mice in both non-spatial and spatial reference memory in the absence of differences in reflexes and anxiety. Generally, middle-aged mice performed intermediately between the young and aged mice. Neurochemical assays are currently being performed to see if these behavioral deficits can be linked to age-related alterations in acetylcholine levels.

145,1998,An Examination of the Mechanism Underlying Implicit Memory for Novel Word Associations,"Anita Kishore, Psychology '98 "," Margaret Keane, Psychology ","Performance on many tasks can be influenced by prior experiences even if one is not deliberately recalling those experiences. This form of unconscious memory for prior events or experiences is referred to as implicit memory or priming. Amnesic patients demonstrate normal priming even though they cannot explicitly or deliberately remember recent events. One theory that attempts to explain this pattern of spared and impaired memory performance predicts that amnesic patients should not show priming for novel word associations. Experiments designed to test this prediction, however, have yielded mixed results. The present study tests the following hypotheses: 1) Tasks in which amnesic patients show normal associative priming tap implicit memory for novel perceptual associations; and 2) Tasks in which amnesic patients show impaired associative priming tap implicit memory for novel conceptual associations. These hypotheses are tested by examining how new-associative priming is affected by perceptual and conceptual manipulations in normal cognition.",1998,Psychology,Psychology

In addition to persistent alterations in neuro-chemicals, the lesions produce long-lasting alterations in the animal's behavior. In adulthood, lesioned mice perform a simple delayed non-match to sample (D MS) odor discrimination task faster and more accurately than control mice. Using this task with lesioned and control mice, we could not determine whether the improved performance of D MS was related to alterations in working memory or attention. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we modified the simple DNMS task by adding multiple presentation trials. Control mice are able to learn these tasks; we are now testing 5,7-DHT lesioned mice on the revised protocol to more accurately assess lesion-induced alterations in performance.

This perception, then, is translated on screen through the presentation or invalidation of female stereotypes. Furthermore, this representation of women often reflects the contemporary cultural climate. This is certainly the case for the films by Italian women directors. Four works by Francesca Archibugi, Liliana Cavani, and Lina Wertmuller all examine women's issues and voice the concerns of the developing feminist movement in Italy from the 1970's through the 1990's. The Night Porter (Cavani, 1974) metaphorically illustrates the growing self-awareness of women and their demand for equal rights. Swept Away ... (Wertmuller, 1974) and Sotto ... sotto (Wertmuller, 1984) both offer critiques of the culturally constructed sexual hierarchy, as well as of the traditional gender roles. Finally, Verso sera (Archibugi, 1990) presents the continuing discussion of a woman's place in society, specifically addressing the issue of motherhood. ",1998,Italian Culture,Italian Studies

When considered concurrently, these repeating elements construct rigid gender roles for Hitchcock's characters. The result is the creation of a cinematic role which can definitively be termed the Hitchcockian Male, and which is the basis for numerous criticisms from feminist film theorists of Hitchcock's alleged misogyny. This Hitchcockian Male is characterized through a repeating cinematic process: an initial tragic emasculation, followed by suffering due to ensuing impotence and incompetence, leading finally to redemption through the necessary submission of a formerly confident and capable female character. Using video accompaniment as visual ""proof,"" I will trace this conception of the Hitchcockian Male by examining closely a few of the more illustrious themes: impotence in Vertigo; voyeurism in Rear Window; homoeroticism in Strangers on a Train; and female sexual promiscuity in Notorious and The Birds.

In this study, the predictions of two competing theories of perceptual priming were tested. The bias mechanism theory predicts that prior exposure to a stimulus (e.g., a butterfly) will facilitate subsequent identification of the stimulus. However, the bias mechanism theory also predicts that prior exposure to a stimulus (e.g., a butterfly) will hinder subsequent identification of a different, but perceptually similar stimulus (e.g., a bow tie). In contrast, the perceptual representation system theory predicts that prior exposure to a stimulus will only facilitate subsequent identification of that stimulus and will have no effect on subsequent identification of perceptually similar stimuli.

The piano is a complex instrument composed of many strings stretched to different tensions. The frequencies of vibrations of the strings can be changed by varying the tensions. Tuning a piano involves adjusting the frequencies considering factors of both absolute and relative pitch, where pitch is related to the perceived frequency. Relative frequencies can be determined by observing ""beats"" or differences between played notes. We consulted with an expert piano tuner who illustrated the use of beats in tuning a piano. Setting the proper relationship among the notes in a scale, or temperament, involves a compromise from ideal mathematical relationships made necessary by the physical properties of the strings as well as human perception.","2001, 2001",Unspecified,Physics

We made measurements by videotaping the trajectory of the ball before and after the bounce. We analyzed the video frame by frame to determine the position and orientation of the ball as functions of time. We found that a bounce pass delivered with backspin does indeed leave the floor at a greater angle than it initially hit and results in the lowest final speed of the ball.

We observed that the corn stems were inclined towards the center of the turntable with the plants at greater distances from the center of the circle at greater angles of inclination than those at lesser distances. This dependence is what one would expect based on the hypothesis that the plants respond to the effective gravitational force they experience in their rotating coordinate system.

The effect of increased imports on these programs, which are an indirect form of protectionism, was called into question. The circumstances surrounding the dispute are unique to the commodity: wheat is an agricultural product that is heavily protected and receives both extensive price support and export subsidies. Indeed, the case before the ITC was one of interventionism compounded: an extensive price support system led to the provision of large export subsidies, which, in turn, led to increased imports and the institution of barriers to trade. Because wheat is not allowed to respond naturally to the market forces of supply and demand, this interventionism has serious consequences on social welfare.

While some argue that risk-sharing and utilization control should bring lower costs and higher quality, antitrust concerns arise when such ventures result in the exchange of competitively sensitive information among competing physicians which enables them to coordinate outside the venture. The issue is further complicated by the argument that the provision of health services is inherently different from all other industries and should therefore receive different treatment from the enforcement agencies.

One area that has received very little attention is the issue of how the Union government raised the nearly two and three-quarters million men needed to fight the war and consequently what incentives were created by the unique ways in which soldiers were asked to serve. Initially, the Union army relied on volunteers, just as they had in the past. However, the volunteer market dried up after about twelve months. It was with this lack of volunteers that the Union turned to initiating a draft. The threat of a draft as well as the actual drafts created many disturbances in the economic market for soldiers. With the use of a micro-level data set of nearly 2000 Union army soldiers from Massachusetts and a data set of substitutes from Iowa, I will show how the techniques used to raise an army by the Union government had profound effects on the local economies, caused much strife within the Union army, and quite probably prolonged the war because of the time it took to rally the troops.

This allows a great possibility for alternative constructions of gender to emerge in virtual communication. The body is both absent (in the literal sense) and ""hyper-present"" in these situations, as individuals seek to reorient themselves to a world in which established methods of doing so are no longer relevant. Without the burden of societal sex/gender polarization and rigid definition, individuals are faced with the opportunity and challenge of negotiating their gender identities in internet communication. The pressure of communicating solely through text simultaneously limits and expands the ways in which the individual can form his/her identity in a social context without the burdens associated with ""real life"" interactions (e.g. visual appearance, legal name, self-preservation). What happens when individuals form spaces and identities for their gendered selves in a distinctly non-gendered communications medium?

This study examines whether such a deficit exists by testing the integrity of the transient channel in SPD. Participants will be presented with stimuli of different spatial and temporal frequencies, and sensitivity levels for each type of stimulus will be determined. Since the transient channel mediates the processing of stimuli with low-spatial and high-temporal frequencies, it is expected that persons with SPD will have lower sensitivity levels for these types of stimuli than normal control participants.",1998,Psychobiology and Spanish,Psychology

Since recorded mathematics, the primes have been a confounding and fascinating area of study in which beautiful theorems exist. We are first introduced to the primes through the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, which states that every natural number > 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of primes. When we look at tables of primes we notice that although the number of primes is infinite, the frequency with which they occur among the natural numbers gradually diminishes, suggesting that their density tends to zero. Although computers greatly facilitate the investigation of the primes, the existing methods for computing primes are still only approximations. This unpredictable behavior makes the primes an enigmatic and compelling area of mathematics in which most conjectures remain unproved and problems unsolved. ",1998,Mathematics,Mathematics

The transformation of cells causes an increase in the rate of RNA and DNA synthesis and a decrease in the selectivity of enzymes compared to those of normal cells. Nucleoside analogs are designed to target the enzymes of these transformed cells, while causing minimal toxicity to the highly selective normal cells. This decrease in the selectivity of transformed cells would potentially cause key enzymes to interact with compounds that are structurally similar to the adenosine and inosine nucleosides: their analogs. We have investigated the synthesis and ribosidation of chlorotriazole as an intermediate in generating precursors to nucleoside analogs. Elaboration of the chlorotriazole can lead to a variety of bicyclic heterocycle synthesis. Ribosidation of cholorotriazole by fusion with a protected ribose produced the expected three nucleosides, with ribose at N, being predominant. Unambiguous elucidation of the structures of these nucleosides will be discussed. ",1999,Biology and Economics,Chemistry

The retardation of RNA synthesis has, therefore, been a focus of anti viral chemotherapy. Since viruses require host cell nucleotides to synthesize viral DNA or RNA, adenosine and inosine are crucial nucleoside precursors to essential processes in the cell and the virus. By creating nucleoside analogs that mimic the structure of the naturally occurring nucleosides, viral replication can be decreased. As part of our work on the syntheses of adenosine and inosine nucleoside analogs, we have investigated the use of selectively N-substituted triazolinones. Phenyl analogs were used as models in order to develop the syntheses for the bicyclic heterocyclic ring systems. Phenyl triazolinone was chlorinated by reaction with phosphoryl chloride, generating a phenyl chlorotriazole intermediate. This chlorinated intermediate allowed for nucleophilic substitution at C3 by cyanide. Subsequent reduction of the nitrile then yielded the immediate precursor to both analogs.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the LOX1 gene is highly expressed in the root. Studies of LOX1 expression using a promoter/b-glucuronidase reporter gene construct are under way. Transgenic plants were created using a vacuum infiltration technique. These transgenic plants have revealed that LOX1 expression is localized to the epidermal cells of the root. Though the promoter/reporter gene system is a useful way of visualizing the expression of a gene, the reporter gene could be showing a different expression pattern than the endogenous gene. For this reason, the LOX1 gene expression is also being studied using immunostaining of thin sections of the Arabidopsis thaliana root. ",1998,Biochemistry,Biological Sciences

We have now extended these findings to include the activation of another substrate, MCC (7- methoxycoumarin-4-carboxyl) -peptide by calcium and manganese, and of MCA-peptide by cadmium ions. The activating effect of cadmium appears to be more dependent on substrate on thiol concentrations than is the effect of the other divalent ions.

James Kodera, Religion ","Tammy Chu: My paper focuses on the phenomena of Asians passing for a different Asian ethnicity within the United States. During the early 1900s, the writer Winnifred Eaton who was half Chinese and half English, passed as Japanese under the pseudonym of Onoto Watanna. During World War II, Fred Korematsu, a Japanese American, passed as Spanish Hawaiian by changing his name and having minor plastic surgery. Through a comparative analysis of the historical contexts within which these individuals ""passed,"" l will explore how race and ethnicity are constructed in the United States during times of national crisis and the relationship between passing, racism, and internalized racism. In particular, I will study how anti-Chinese sentiment, exemplified by the Chinese Exclusion Act, and anti-Japanese sentiment, exemplified by Executive Order 9066, were part of larger political, social, and economic movements to constrict the literal and figurative boundaries of America in order to sustain white privilege and power. Shana Nishihira: Approximately 34,000 Americans of Asian descent served in the U.S. Armed Forces in Vietnam during the Vietnam War. While a numerical minority, their experiences as Asians fighting against Asians in what has been characterized as a ""racist"" war, together with the historical need for them to prove their American identity, and the specific experience of Japanese American internment, work to make significant the Asian American presence in Vietnam. Due to the fact that published critical discussions and first person accounts on this subject remain few, I used interviews with several Asian American veterans for the core of this paper. Through their accounts of their experiences as Asian American soldiers and the secondary sources available, I examine how an Asian identity, feelings of patriotism, experiences of racism and the formation of ethnic and racial communities in the military in Vietnam shaped and affected the roles Asian Americans played as soldiers during the War. Sonya Rhee: The documentary will focus on students' experiences at an Asian American retreat and I plan to use the retreat as a lens through which we can explore larger issues concerning Asian Americans and our community at Wellesley. The interviews will be conducted with a handful of students who participated in the retreat on Cape Cod. They range from students who have very little experience with Wellesley to those students who have been significantly involved in Asian American issues at Wellesley for four years. This documentary should be seen as only a small step in a larger process in addressing concerns not only within the Asian American community, but within the greater Wellesley community as well. Maria Garrett: This paper examines the portrayal of romantic relationships between Asian men and Caucasian women in Hollywood films over the course of the twentieth century. Many of these films rely on the literature and legacy of ""Yellow Peril"" fears and fantasies to make their stories believable to a white American audience. The threat of sexual contact between the Asian and Caucasian races, a pervasive fear in ""Yellow Peril"" discourse, is perceived as especially potent when an Asian man appears to pose a sexual threat to a Caucasian woman. I will examine three themes in American cinematic depictions of Asian men in relationships with Caucasian women: the inscrutable sexual predator, the pedophile, and the sexually impotent nerd. Rather than attempt an analysis grounded purely in cultural studies, I have situated the race and gender stereotypes at the heart of these cinematic narratives within other cultural institutions such as American humor, cartoons, photography, newspapers and United States anti-miscegenation and immigration laws. Hollywood's interracial romances, and the images, stereotypes, and stories of which they are composed, are not random. Rather, these romances grew out of institutions that surrounded the production of their stories.","1999, 1998","Film Studies, Anthropology and Cognitive Science",Religion

But as a reworking of Sophocles' classic, Anouilh's play is more authentic to the original when the antagonists engage in a struggle in which either could be, and is, in the right.

Donne defeats death triumphantly by attacking it with violent verbal ""strokes"" (12) and harnessing it into the rigid structure of the sonnet. Herrick attains his gentle dominion over death by ""fitting"" (10) it into his pious, melodious song; his ""feet of innocence"" (14) progress along all the steps of a traditional Christian path to insure his ultimate salvation and everlasting life. Vaughan gains supremacy over death by an act of poetic redemption; his simple devotional verses counteract the sinful, deadly lyrics of his seventeenth century predecessors, thus delivering and resurrecting poetry from its fallen, death-ridden state.

Participants completed measures of self-esteem and sexual self-esteem, as well as measures that analyzed the parenting style and parental nurturance of the participants' parents. The relationship between these variables was examined using correlations and backward regressions. Results indicate that masculine sex-role orientation has a strong predictive relationship for self-esteem as well as for sexual self-esteem. Authoritative parenting style also had some predictive value for self-esteem as did parental nurturance. The correlation, however, between both self- and sexual-esteem and the masculine sex-role orientation was much stronger. These results possibly indicate that possession of socially valued traits have a stronger influence on self-esteem than family.",2000,Psychology,Psychology

The study of cross-cultural variations in scripts may expand our understanding of the nature and impact of interpersonal misunderstandings. For example, this study examined Korean American college women's perceptions of their mothers' emotional responses across different achievement situations. The underlying premise for this study is that Korean American women have been influenced by both Asian and American values, potentially creating conflict between themselves and their more traditional Asian mothers. Using four hypothetical achievement scenarios, students rated how they thought their mothers ""would"" and ""should"" respond emotionally. Average discrepancy scores between ""would"" and ""should"" responses were computed and analyzed statistically. In addition, discrepancies were correlated with standardized measures of relationship quality and self-esteem. The implications of these findings for Korean American daughter and mother relationships will be discussed.",1999,Psychology,Psychology

A synthetic model for this adenosine analog, 6-amino-3-phenylimidazo-3 ,4-b-triazole, was created by the substitution of a phenyl group for the ribose substituent. The difficulty in this research was the production of the cyanated product, 3-cyano-4-phenyl-1,2,4- triazole. The cyanation of 4-phenyl-1,2,4- triazole occurs through the electrophilic addition of the cyano cation to the triazole anion. Previous research used n-butyllithium to create the triazole anion, yet this strategy led to the formation of side products. Another base, t-butyllithium, was used since it is more basic and less nucleophilic.

Its iconographic peculiarity, a sleeping, nude Mars watched by an alert, clothed Venus, is uniquely related to particular images of Endymion and Paris as well as to early Renaissance admonitory texts on sexual excess and marriage. Endymion, Paris, and Mars are three mythological men who are, to varying degrees, portrayed nude, reclining, and asleep before a goddess's gaze. What does it signify to early Renaissance minds to see a man, whether a Classical Endymion, early Renaissance Paris, or late-Quattrocento Mars, lie unconscious or nude before this female gaze? It is the purpose of this paper to describe, through Classical and early Renaissance visual and literary analogies with which Botticelli would have been familiar, the consequences of sexual surrender.",1999,Unspecified,Art
273,1999,Eroticism Contrived: Female Sexuality in the Painting and Drawing of Gustav Klimt,"Amy Weinstein, Art History '99","Pat Berman, Art","Fin-de-siÃ¨cle Europe was characterized by legitimate discussions of sex in scientific and artistic circles. Many new theories of sexuality and femininity, such as those of Sigmund Freud, Richard von Krafft-Ebing, and Otto Weininger, created overwhelming sexual and political obstacles for women who were busy fighting for voting rights and other freedoms. Artistic representations of women, often negative and violent, were laced with the general fears and misunderstandings of female sexuality and emotion. Women's sexuality had been transformed into a mysteriously intriguing entity, often grouped with hysteria and mental illness. Gustav Klimt, Vienna's most celebrated painter, created several paintings and many erotic drawings depicting lesbian sexual intimacy. A budding cultural awareness of sexuality, influenced by Freud's writing and contemporary medical journals, inspired men to paint their fears and desires on canvas, unintentionally creating a theme of contrived eroticism in art.",1999,Art History,Art

Initially, these artists remained largely disengaged from politics, preferring to transcend rather than confront contemporary social and political ills by exploring spiritual, folkloric landscapes. Despite the apolitical orientation of nonconformist art, the Soviet government identified it as politically tendentious and expelled deviant artists from the Artists' Unions. By the mid 1970s, these artists had fully embraced their status as dissident artists, a transition marked by their more daring and politically motivated confrontations with the Soviet authorities. This development is also reflected in the concurrent emergence of an art highly critical of Soviet political and social institutions. Unofficial artists did not rest long upon the peak of their achievement in the 1970s, as the Soviet government initiated a strategy to diffuse the political and aesthetic force of the unofficial art movement by co-opting mildly aberrant artists and encouraging the more confrontational artists to emigrate.",1999,History,History

Infrared spectroscopy and Si-29 INEPT, C-13, and H-1 NMR were employed to analyze the results of the organic syntheses, and specifically the absorption of the Si-H bond in each reaction. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy also aided in identifying the organosilicon compounds. In addition, the charge and hybridization of silicon predicted by theoretical (semi-empirical) calculations, performed using Spartan 5.0, were compared to the chemical shifts and coupling constants obtained from the Si-29 NMR spectra.

This loss of electron density is shown in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum as a large increase in the chemical shift (downfield). Silicon, however, demonstrates the opposite trend: when bonded to certain electronegative groups, silicon gains electron density, which is indicated by a decrease in the chemical shift (upfield). Possible bonding mechanisms will be investigated for two particular types of organosilicon compounds: diisopropylsilyltriflates and diisopropylsilyltrifluoroacetates.

Kinetic studies of EP 24.15 activity in the presence and absence of CaCl2 were carried out and analyzed using several algorithms. The Km of MCC cleavage decreased in the presence of Ca2 + while the Vmax remained unaltered. These results suggest that metal ions increase the affinity of ligand binding in an ion- and substrate-specific manner. To explore the mechanism of calcium-mediated increase in ligand affinity, EP24.15 activity was assayed in the presence of Ca2 + after substrate preincubation with Ca2 +; this preincubation decreased the Km without affecting Vmax, suggesting that Ca2 + may increase hydrolysis by interacting with the ligand.

In surface science experiments, gaseous reactants are deposited on highly ordered, single crystalline surfaces with well-defined atomic structure and chemical composition at ultrahigh vacuum (10-11 Torr) pressures. We have studied the reactions of formaldehyde on a Molybdenum single crystal catalyst because formaldehyde is involved in many important industrial reactions.

Dolls are very much a part of childrens' (and especially little girls') imaginative lives and development, and act as charged symbols of societal understandings of adult life. Much in the way that children use dolls to explore implicit roles and their developing ideas, we became interested in photographing dolls as a similar sort of play - a mock of human experiences and understandings of the world. We specifically chose to align the dolls in the positions of life that both evoke common human experiences (based largely on our personal daily activities at Wellesley) and that emphasize their artifice and the fact that they are dolls and cannot be human.

Since the Second World War many more people have been killed as victims of domestic massacres and genocides than by international war. Most recently, a brutal war raged in what was once Yugoslavia. Although Western nations had documented evidence that ethnic cleansing was taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina, we could not agree about what might be done. And, the killing continued. The Code X List project was designed to enable students to experience categorization first hand, a depersonalized process that is central to genocide. In cases of genocide individuals are selected for elimination because they meet a set of well-defined criteria for group membership.

In these sonnets, Rossetti employs his keen painter's eye to create a proliferation of surfaces, including objects of art, embodied ideals, natural settings, women's bodies, and the sonnet form itself, upon which his speaker pursues his quest. Such dependence on surface rejects the tendency of the spiritual quester for introspection and abstract thought, thus proposing another method of questing and raising some significant questions: Why is surface essential for transcendence in Rossetti's poetry?

The literature supports the idea that while these tasks are difficult for three-year olds, the addition of active participation and the incorporation of pretense improves their performance by adding finer gradations to the measurements of these skills. This study tested three- and four-year olds' ability to perform on easier variations of the original tasks: appearance-reality with the addition of active participation (deception) and false belief with the addition of both active participation and pretense. While the pretense scenario did not bring about the expected improvement, the addition of deception did support the hypothesis for both tasks.",1999,Psychology,Psychology

Race and type of leadership style did not interact as we predicted. Our findings showed that our subjects gave positive evaluations for both leadership styles, regardless of leaders' ethnic background. The subjects indicate that female leaders need to have both task and social leadership skills to be a successful leader in the workplace. The few significant race effects showed that the subjects preferred the minority leaders to the Caucasian leaders.

It is vital that nation-states be able to maintain identity, but not at the cost of successful global relations. Human rights conflicts provide an excellent venue for examining cultural conflicts, by demonstrating the way in which differing cultural perspectives can obscure the real issues behind several transnational conflicts. By introducing the concept of moral relativism, or the view that standards are grounded in social approval, and contrasting it with another extreme, cultural imperialism, an epistemological midpoint can be identified. The work of thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Jean-Paul Sartre and Edward Said will help to define this midpoint and contribute to a detailed approach to resolving cultural conflicts.",2000,Philosophy,Philosophy

Formed in 1959 and featuring bassist Scott LaFaro and drummer Paul Motian, this ensemble forged a more balanced trio dynamic than was customary. The soloist-oriented language of postwar jazz generally relegated the bassist and drummer of a piano trio to subordinate roles; by contrast, LaFaro and Motian were granted an unprecedented degree of musical freedom. Most significantly, a form of improvisational dialogue dominated the Trio's work, rather than a traditional sequence of solos. While many musicians of the 1950s subverted conventional jazz forms and structures, the Evans Trio practiced their collective improvisation within standard harmonic and formal constraints. Despite this conservatism, the Trio embraced the same burgeoning philosophy of creative and improvisational freedom that characterized the more rebellious music that would come to be known as ""free jazz.""",1999,Music,Music

While architectural changes come slowly under these constraints, reinterpretation of old forms is necessary in order to meet the evolving needs of those who utilize the buildings. This hypothesis is supported with a slide presentation and discussion of four Quaker meeting houses in southeastern Massachusetts - Sandwich, Yarmouth, and Falmouth on Cape Cod, and Apponegansett on the mainland. The latter eighteenth-century building illustrates the ""typical"" New England Quaker meeting house form.

An extension of Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, biophilia is a positive, innate response to specific aspects of the natural landscape. The biophilic response is triggered because these landscape features were indicators of favorable conditions crucial to early man's survival, such as food, water and safety. Olmsted generously employed specific landscape features with the intent of promoting such positive responses.

In 1959, Chinua Achebe published Things Fall Apart, a .novel about an African tribe before and after colonial exposure. Critics revered Achebe's work because it delivered not only a voice, but also an identity, to ""that dumb thing"" silenced by Conrad. By negating Conrad's images, Achebe succeeded in undermining racialized portrayals of African identity but failed to deliver a sustainable voice. By imposing silence on Okonkwo, Achebe symbolically imposes silence on all Africans, and thus irrevocably links himself to Conrad.",1999,English,English

For political thought, the outcome of this discourse determines how the community is shaped. Thomas Aquinas, Ibn Rushd and Muhammad 'Abduh, despite their different eras and traditions, are each drawn to this problem. For lbn Rushd and Abduh, the problem is whether philosophy has a place in the Muslim tradition of revealed truth. If so, what are the implications for wisdom and authority in the community? For Aquinas, the concern is finding a place for critical reason in Christianity and discovering what it could mean for social hierarchy and law. Because they address the same question, these three theorists invite comparison. However, the task itself raises new questions about comparing across time and culture. Therefore, it might be necessary to frame this traditional debate differently to engage with the work of each philosopher and find effective bases for comparison.",1999,Political Science,Political Science

In bottle experiments, D. pulex were given a phosphate supplement and their growth rate was measured. The growing season is much shorter in Alaska than in Wisconsin, and D. pulex populations in Alaska have a faster growth rate. Changes in cell content to achieve this faster growth rate change the nitrogen:phosphorus ratio of the organism, and put the organism at a greater potential for phosphorus limitation. If the D. pulex populations in Alaska are limited by phosphorus, they should exhibit a greater increase in growth rate in response to the phosphorus addition than the D. pulex populations in Wisconsin.

For example, males are better than females at spatial memory tasks. The major source of cholinergic input to the ""cognitive"" regions of the brain arises from subcortical neurons residing in the basal forebrain (BF). Previous studies in rodents have shown that the BF cholinergic system develops differentially in males and females, with the system maturing faster in females. No one, however, has determined if differences in the developing cholinergic system exist from inception (birth of cholinergic neurons in the BF). The purpose of this study is to examine if there are sex differences in the neurogenesis (birthdate) of BF cholinergic neurons in mice. Pregnant mice will be injected with a birthdating agent, which is incorporated into the DNA of actively dividing fetal cells.

Slug populations in eight forest patches were enumerated and the length of individual slugs was measured. Determinations were made of the percent soil moisture, percent canopy cover, leaf litter depth, and soil nutrient concentration of each forest patch. Sites with higher soil moisture and nutrient content and less canopy cover and leaf litter had higher total slug population. I incorporated these findings into an age-structured simulation model that predicts R, the net reproductive rate of the slug population, given specific environmental conditions. Calcium concentration of the soil was strongly correlated with slug population size in each site. The model predicts that R < 1 in seven of the forest fragments, indicating that slug population in these patches may be sustained by immigration from nearby lawns.",1999,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

Our research has focused on the development of reliable methods for identifying and quantifying cyanophycinase, the enzyme which breaks down CGP, in cell extracts. CGP is highly insoluble, making most direct assays difficult and poorly reproducible. Gel electrophoresis using gels permeated with protease substrates revealed that cell extracts contain several enzymes, including some with molecular weights corresponding to that of cyanophycinase, capable of digesting casein. Since casein might be a suitable substrate for cyanophycinase, yellow casein was used in a colorimetric assay. In tests of crude cell extracts, casein digestion was observed after incubation. Current work focuses on the optimization of the yellow-casein assay. Another approach investigated has been the possibility of permeating gels with CGP itself and using these gels to test cell extracts. Although difficult to carry out, such an assay would offer far greater specificity than replacement-substrate assays.","2001, 2001",Unspecified,Chemistry

As the proverb goes, ""Whoever controls distribution, controls cinema."" The economic power of film distribution, despite the continual growth of African Cinema since its inception in the 1960s, is still dominated by foreign-based companies, preventing the establishment of strong domestic film industry and impeding the creation of national cinemas on the cultural, economic, political, and social levels. While inventing an aesthetic of Black African Cinema within the world tradition, artists are attempting to balance socio-political filmmaking and the preservation of indigenous cultural traditions with commercially viable creations.

Following World War II, Latin American states emerged as independent world actors that challenged existing international law based on the depletion of the fish stocks near their coastal shores. Chile, Equador, and Peru passed laws which extended their territorial seas to 200 miles. Over the next thirty years, a United Nations Convention met to codify Jaw of the sea; they drafted a set of international norms which now regulate territorial seas and conserve natural resources.

Considering, however, that Hollywood was founded by Eastern European Jewish immigrants who were caught in the struggle of mediating between the Old World and the New, the absence of ethnicity in their films hardly seems plausible. The musical was the only genre in which the movie moguls could most effectively assert the importance of entertainment in the lives of the audience and thereby justify their own positions as the nation's arbiter of such entertainment. The musical also evoked nostalgia for strong families and communities, something that was lacking in the moguls' poverty-stricken youth.

Furthermore, it can be shown that the prime divisors of f(x) = x2 + 1 are 2 and all of the primes p for which the remainder is 1 when p is divided by 4.

Despite their frequent use, little has been done to determine how far predators can smell these tablets, or how the distance of first detection varies with changes in weather conditions. Two Australian Shepherds and one Samoyed, all obedience and agility trained, were used to study how far standard odor attractant tablets can be detected. The greatest downwind distance a test dog was able to detect odor from a tablet was 1,029 meters. This occurred with 85 % relative humidity, an air temperature of 74Â· F, and a slight breeze ( < 1 mph). Changes in the dogs' first detection distances appear to be correlated with wind and other weather conditions. This information may aid researchers in estimating the distances from which wild predators are attracted to scent stations.",1999,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

Within minutes, cells that survive acid shock also neutralize the external medium to around pH 6 suggesting this response is needed for survival through acidic conditions. A variety of experiments were carried out to study this acid tolerance response. Acid shocked exponentially growing cells that were able to tolerate acid shock returned to exponential growth after a lag phase. In vivo 31 P-NMR spectroscopy revealed that during acid shock, cells did not lyse and the internal pH of the cells was lowered by, but was not equivalent to, the acidic pH medium.

Lincomycin was added to cells once they entered exponential growth. A concentration of 0.5 Âµg/ml lincomycin caused the leveling off of the growth rate. If more than 0.5 Âµg/ml lincomycin was added, the cells lysed; if less, the cells continued exponential growth. The absence of polyphosphate was determined using NMR spectroscopy. Other inhibitors of transcription and translation, such as chlorotetracycline, will also be tested for their ability to cause polyphosphate formation.","2001, 2001, 2002",Unspecified,Biological Sciences

Typical upper body strengthening exercises, such as the bench press and the overhead press, do not address the scapula. Scapular stability can, however, play a key role in shoulder injuries. The Athletic Training staff of Wellesley College focuses on shoulder stability as part of the prescreening program for all varsity athletes, because of the strong correlation between stability and injury. The human shoulder joint is very unstable, compared to other joints. Because of the greater range of motion that occurs in the shoulder joint, the stability must come from muscles rather than ligaments. The shoulder is susceptible to subluxation or dislocation when the muscles are not strong. The scapular stabilizers not only help with injury prevention, but also with overall upper body strength. Ever wonder why you cannot do a push up? Weak shoulder stabilizers could be part of the problem. There are a number of simple exercises that can help strengthen scapular stabilizers and assist that can help strengthen scapular stabilizers and assist with shoulder strength, as well as help prevent shoulder injury.",1999,Geology,Unspecified

Previous research suggests that the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP-Cl00) may be linked to the cognitive deficits seen in AD, and that mice which overexpress C-100 are impaired on cognitive spatial tasks. To test whether the amount of expression of C-100 affects the age of onset of spatial deficits or the magnitude of deficits, mice were genetically manipulated to overexpress either one (heterozygotes) or two (homozygotes) copies of the C-100 gene. Animals at four months and eight months old were tested in each group in a spatial task called the Morris Water Maze. Eight month-old homozygotes showed the most spatial impairment and homozygotes at both ages showed deficits when compared to controls and heterozygotes.

During the past thirty years, Nigerians immigrants have become an increasingly visible segment of the foreign-born black population in the United States. Removed from their country of origin, first and second generation Nigerians must begin to understand and assert their personal identities in relation to American culture. What paths are they taking with respect to identity formation? Are the younger Nigerians identifying more closely with their African American peers, abandoning their cultural backgrounds, or are they maintaining their own national identities?

The interview questions were designed to ascertain the respondents' ideas about his or her ethnicity in America. Questions, situated in scenarios such as family interactions, neighborhood, school, and Haiti, delved into how the individuals constructed and dealt with their identity in those situations and how their ethnic identity was established in contrast or comparison to other ethnic groups. Parental attitudes towards African Americans, parental value establishment and deep familial ties all affected and aided these individuals in developing their ethnic identity. The use of explicit markers, that are symbolic of a Haitian connection, were used to differentiate themselves from African Americans and illustrate this difference to others.

I have chosen Turkey not only because I am Turkish, but also because different theories of nationalism can be applied to the emergence, growth, and future visions of the Turkish national identity. Here, Turkey's denial of killings of Armenians in 1915 and Armenia's insistence on an apology from the Turkish government provide insights into various aspects of Turkish nationalism. In light of these points, my thesis begins with an application of theories of nationalism to Turkey. It follows with how the Armenian case reveals the identity problem of the Turkish nation. This will lead into the concluding analysis of the possible structural and internal pressures that might impinge on the character of Turkish nationalism. By referring to the role played by the 1915 massacres and the formation of the Turkic Central Asian states, the thesis overall examines how Turkish-Armenian relations today reveal important characteristics of the Turkish national identity.

Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) are a category of proteoglycans that influence neural development and plasticity throughout adult life. The degree of GAG sidechain sulfation may influence the functions of the proteoglycans to which they are attached. The sulfation of GAG sugar residues is catalyzed by sulfotransferases, and the analysis of these enzymes contributes to understanding proteoglycan function. Chondroitin sulfotransferase (CST) is involved in the modification of certain CSPGs of the CNS. The anatomical localization of the enzyme is unknown; thus, my current work is geared towards assessing the levels of CST mRNA expression within the CNS of early postnatal and adult mice.

The resulting meshwork of filamentous actin is essential for many cellular processes, including cell movement, cell growth, and cell division. Actin-binding proteins assist in actin\'s various cellular functions. While many actin binding proteins have been identified and characterized in mammalian cells, little is known about these proteins in plant cells.

The synthesis of the model analog, 6-amino-3-phenylimidazo-2,3-c)-triazole was conceived to proceed through the intermediate 3-cyano-4-phenyl-l,2,4)-triazole. Various synthetic strategies resulted in the addition of the cyano substituent at the 3 position of the triazole ring. The most effective of these involved direct cyanation with an electrophilic cyanating agent. Our studies demonstrate that the intermediate cation of phenyltriazole, generated from reaction with cyanogen bromide, in which the cyano group is bonded to one of the nitrogens of the triazole ring, is susceptible to nucleophilic attack at C-3. If the bromide from cyanogen bromide is not removed, the major product is bromophenyltriazole, while the removal of the bromide ion allows for rearrangement of the cyano group to the C-3 position. Alternatively, excess cyanide added to the reaction acts as a nucleophile, attacking C-3 and causing subsequent loss of HCN.",2000,Chemistry,Chemistry

427,2000,Other ,"Natalie Biggs, English and Russian '00 "," James Noggle, English ","In her extended body of work, Emily Dickinson demonstrates an adherence to the heritage of the sublime, even though her exact location in this sublime tradition remains elusive. The poetry of Dickinson appears to testify, both stylistically and thematically, to the tradition of the masculine sublime established by Longinus. Although she in many ways fulfills the Longinian definition of the sublime, Dickinson\'s characteristic ""purification"" of language, her self-destructive internalization of the split between self and other, and her opposition to the traditional masculine sense of the sublime, demonstrate her departure from the classic text of Longinus. Further, Dickinson differs from the more self-assured masculine sublime poets, Emerson and Wordsworth, in her relentless and repetitive deconstruction of herself and her relation to power. Yet this very self-destructive element in Dickinson functions subversively: she questions and condemns herself in order to commemorate herself. For while Dickinson may not attain accolades within the tradition of the masculine sublime, she uses its form to destroy her own image and, by doing so, to dramatize her immortality. Indeed, the poetry of Emily Dickinson achieves dual sublime success: by recognizably participating in the tradition of Longinus, she remains a valid voice in the sublime tradition while she subtly changes it from within.

430,2000,Late Serialism: Public and Private Discourse in the Music of Boulez and Babbitt ,"Brigid Cohen, Music '00 "," Martin Brody, Music ","My thesis explores developments in serial composition after 1960 through a consideration of works by Pierre Boulez and Milton Babbitt. Serialism, a method of composition based on the ordering of compositional elements, became a unifying focus of attention for composers during the years immediately following World War II. Many composers recognized in serialism a potential to revolutionize Western musical culture. By 1965, however, serialism\'s revolutionary promise remained largely unfulfilled. Serial composers operated within a problematic cultural framework that undermined their claim to legitimacy. An ever-increasing plurality of musical influences, such as indeterminacy, improvisation, world music, and minimalism, weakened serial composers\' sense of a unified historical imperative. In addition, the growing prestige of popular music led many to question traditional hierarchies of popular and elite, jeopardizing this critical distinction in avant-garde theory. Widespread disillusionment with Cold War politics gradually replaced much of the post-war ""ground zero"" cultural optimism of the 1950s, which had fueled the serial revival. My thesis addresses how serial composers pursued a civic engagement in this environment and how this engagement shaped the development of their serial thought. I ultimately seek to demonstrate that even those idioms that seem most private and adamantine may, in fact, yield substantial public meaning. ",2000,Music,Music

Although the Internet community is becoming more diverse, the Internet is still a tool for the more educated and the wealthier citizens. As it becomes more significant in different life areas, the gap between those who have access to this technology and those that do not will become more consequential. I have been involved in a study that considered how people use the Internet for political purposes. The data are drawn from experiments held during municipal elections in two racially diverse cities, Baltimore and Philadelphia. Subjects, who were representative citizens of each city, came to a research facility and were directed to view certain political web sites. Administrators gathered qualitative data, in the form of participants' reactions to their on-line session in focus groups, as well as quantitative data, in the form of surveys taken before and after the on-line session. In processing these data, the study will determine just how everyday people use the Internet in low visibility elections.

It has been speculated that one of the reasons for this amazing survival is due to cyanobacteria's ability to store materials needed for their existence. Nitrogen is stored as cyanophycin (CGP) and phycobilisomes, carbon is stored as polyglucose and poly-b-hydroxybutyrate, and phosphate is stored as polyphosphate. My presentation focuses on the synthesis and degradation of CGP, a co-polymer made up of the amino acids arginine and aspartic acid under chloramphenicol stress, studied by proton NMR spectroscopy.

Several different concentrations of each inhibitor are being tested in hopes of finding the concentration that would make the cyanobacterium enter stationary phase at a faster rate than normal. Once the correct concentrations are found, both for Rifampcin and Chlortetracycline, the cells will be grown to a high concentration and NMR spectroscopy will be used to determine the presence or absence of polyphosphate in these cultures.

While Vonnegut applies the metaphor of man as a machine, Irving suggests that man is, instead, essentially animal. The repercussions this holds for man's free will, or lack of it, are explored in many contexts by both authors. The spheres, war and religion, provide heightened contexts in which each author explores the potential for ownership of action. Each tries to reconcile his ideas about volition with man's capacity for weakness and greatness, Jove and brutality, good and evil. Also important to my thesis is the degree to which each author is able to export his world view to the reader and what the reader takes from the novels about himself and mankind. My work draws from philosophy and religious texts as can illuminate these two examples of the contemporary novelist.

Most writing in French by Algerians is in some part taken as a response to European perspectives, with or without the author's intention.

In fact, her narrators seem to reinforce certain ideas that are typically Western regarding the Oriental woman.

This image, however, fails to account for the demographic, ideological, and cultural changes resulting from two devastating global wars and a decline of the British empire during the past century. Such disruptions have caused a restructuring of classes and the mobility between them, but such changes are not often recognized by the public.

Specifically, my analysis focuses on three works: E.M. Forster\'s Howards End, Kazuo lshiguro\'s The Remains of the Day, and Hanif Kureishi\'s Buddha of Suburbia. I study the ways in which speech acts as one of the most obvious markers of social class in literature, and the subsequent social rules that govern speech propriety within and between the classes. My research includes a study of the characters in these novels and their language use in relation to their physical location as well as how they use language to speak about the English landscape. I also discuss the role of the great English country house, and how its acquisition and its cultural associations have determined who is considered and permitted to define the notion of Englishness.

These works deal with the different aspects of ethnic impersonations: the dangers of stereotypical representations; the performance dimension of impersonations; power dynamics related to race, class, and gender; questions of authenticity and responsibility; and the confines of historicity. As I explore impersonated ethnicity, I am looking at how this controversial phenomenon reflects upon the complex identity struggles in multiethnic America.

Neither one knew the other, however, the early poems of Rimbaud and the paintings of Van Gogh exhibit a remarkable correspondence in both theme and structure. Specifically, I will compare Rimbaud's Sensation with Van Gogh's Wheatfield with Cypress, as well as Roman by Rimbaud and Sidewalk Cafe, Evening by Van Gogh. The sexualization of nature, the symbolic possibilities of color, and a meticulous attention to composition characterize the works of both artists. Above all, Rimbaud and Van Gogh possessed the ability to transform ordinary scenes into extraordinary worlds radiating with life and emotion. Vibrant colors, textures of paint, sounds of words, and ingenious images work together to engage all five senses and transport the reader and spectator into the unique worlds of the artists.

In different cultures, social mores dictate limits of acceptable sexuality. Cinema challenges such limits. By examining similar themes (homoeroticism, infidelity, obsession, prostitution, etc.) in films from various countries, we can see how cultures differ in their idea of what is depraved, deviant, unfit for viewing, and what is an artistic representation of human sexuality. This topic, by nature of its explicitness, gets right to the heart of a nation's values, not only in its regard to sex, but to a whole host of social, political, and moral issues.

This study examined the effects of time spent with father on sex-role flexibility in preschool girls. Time fathers and daughters spent together was assessed through a parent questionnaire. To assess sex-role flexibility, we used a toy-preference task in which children were asked to indicate their preference for a stereotypically masculine toy, a stereotypically feminine toy, or both toys.

However, this issue of reporting discrepancy has not been the focus of any study on the impact of domestic violence on children. The present study attempted to address that issue.

We are now testing whether an organism's lifestyle is correlated with the size and number of olfactory glomeruli in closely related species that have divergent lifestyles: genetically blinded vs. sighted crayfish, and crayfish living in fast-moving streams vs. stagnant waters. These will define whether differences in olfactory needs correlate with differences in the structure of the olfactory centers. This would be expected if evolutionary pressures have selected for increased glomerular numbers in those species where a more elaborate olfactory sense would have provided a selective advantage.

Previous studies have examined the effects of lesions to the parietal, frontal, and occipital cortices on the MGN (the main auditory relay station of the thalamus) of animals. This study includes temporally lesioned animals in the experiment. Animals were lesioned with a freezing probe and microgyria were induced in all four cortices.

We sought to establish an appropriate animal model to study the effectiveness of N20 induced drinking suppression. Rats underwent a limited access condition; one hour each day they had access to either water or ethanol. The highest alcohol-consuming rats were selected from each strain and exposed for various durations to a N20 mixture or pure oxygen. These exposures occurred every four days, scheduled to end one hour before a limited access condition. Consistent with earlier results, exposure to N20 suppressed alcohol consumption in rats in a dose-dependent manner. This result confirms the effectiveness of N20 in selectively suppressing alcohol drinking, establishing a rat model appropriate for use in studying the basic mechanisms underlying this effect.

A previous study on lobsters showed the presence of an enzyme that produces nitric oxide, nitric oxide synthase (NOS), in specific brain regions during larval life of Homarus americanus. We are focusing specifically on the role of NO in synaptogenesis in the accessory and olfactory lobes in developing lobsters. We are asking whether the period of glomerular formation, which we believe is correlated with synaptogenesis, coincides with the time when NO labeling is seen. Brains and nerve cords from embryos and all larval stages were labeled for NOS and examined. Preliminary results suggest that NOS labeling does occur at the predicted times of synaptogenesis.

The early years of both protagonists are characterized by an isolation from society on a remote country estate, a desire to commune with nature, and a sense of timeless continuity. Despite these similarities, the boys' family relationships prepare them differently for adult life; Chateaubriand's sense of alienation from his parents prepares him for the harsh realities of the world, while the overprotection Oblomov receives from his family prevents him from fitting into society as an adult.

Several scholars have noted Rushdie's attempt to write India, or narrate nation, in terms that render his narratives curiously misogynistic. By identifying specifically Indian and gendered idioms at work in the novel, I find that Rushdie's production of masculinity is far from secure and indeed rests on a pervasive male anxiety about female power. The politics and the aesthetics of that masculinity are mediated by feminine tropes - of maya (the principle of illusion) and mata (the figure of the mother). Midnight's Children, then, reveals a complicated negotiation of nationhood and national subjectivity that is made possible by and through women.

Coleman, Chemistry ","The Beer-Lambert Law states that the absorbance of a solution should be linearly dependent on the concentration of the absorbing species. However, the uranyl ion (UO/+) in dilute acidic media does not obey this law between 350 and 400nm, although it does so at higher wavelengths. It is unprecedented to have a system that obeys this relationship in some regions of the spectrum but not in others. The uranyl ion also displays anomalies in the emission quantum yield. Assuming that relaxation from upper excited states to the emitting level is essentially 100% efficient, the emission quantum yield should be independent of the excitation wavelength. The relative emission quantum yield of the uranyl ion is wavelength dependent, with a 50% decrease in the quantum yield in the region 350-400nm. The Beer-Lambert Law violation can be explained with a model that involves dimer formation by uranyl ions. The quantum yield behavior is consistent with a multiple excited state model, where high-energy states relax directly to the ground state by non-radiative means. Our focus is on combining these models to develop a single mathematical and chemical model to explain all of our observations. ",2000,Chemistry ,Chemistry

Finger skin was therefore hypothesized to exhibit low temperatures before a migraine attack, and the possibility of using finger skin temperature as an indicator of an upcoming migraine episode was examined. Students from Wellesley College who suffer from migraine headaches participated in the study by agreeing to have measurements of finger and body temperature, sleepiness, heart rate, and activity taken.

Though too often our history of feminism is white-washed, women of color virtually created new feminisms in the same time period that saw the explosion of liberal and radical White feminisms. My thesis historicizes the development of feminist consciousness among Asian-Americans, Blacks, Native Americans and Chicanas and proceeds to discuss the development of feminism grounded in differential oppositional consciousness by radical women of color. My primary sources for the development and evolution of new feminist discourses are Gloria Anzaldua and Cherrie Moraga\'s This Bridge Called My Back, Gloria Anzaldua\'s Making Face Making Soul and Borderlands. These three seminal texts have become cornerstone works which have helped reconstitute feminism by redefining it around the intersubjective experiences of women of color. In building what these writers have dubbed a ""theory of the flesh,"" they disrupt the myths that power our society. The final part of my thesis consists of analyzing the performances of Spiderwoman, a collective theater group of the 1970s and 1980s made up of Native American women. My analysis will focus on the underlying myths that power their performance and their relation to the new feminisms at the beginning of the 21st century.",2000,Women's and Gender Studies,Women's and Gender Studies

Can the egalitarian ideals of socialism be translated to practice? Coupon Socialism provides an economic scheme that combines the equality inherent in socialism and the strength derived from competition in capitalism. By creating two currencies, one for purchasing goods and another ""coupon"" currency for investing in companies, Coupon Socialism alters the economic and social experience of citizens. At a designated age, alt citizens would receive an equal number of coupons for purchasing shares in companies; this allows each citizen to enjoy benefits like those of stockholders, including votes on the board of elections and dividends, in the form of additional coupons. The analysis of Coupon Socialism will include issues of personal identity and social responsibility. ",2000,Philosophy,Political Science

A state begins looking outside its own boundaries only after obtaining a certain degree of political and economic stability. On the international level, Immanuel Kant and John Rawls outline the just, utopian community. Only to some extent, however, should we strive for such a community. There is danger in homogeneity and the resultant decrease in 4:30 - 5:40 ', 'competitive tension. Bombarded by the popular view for a more just society through an international community, we must not abandon the concept of sovereignty. The state, although not in its traditional, nationalistic guise as the sole sovereign power in regional conflicts, is still crucial in international levels of governance. Most importantly, as we face ever increasing talk of ""globalization,"" the state must serve as the unity preserving particular histories of peoples.

However, most of the research on democratization ignores the presence of women. Recognizing that academic void, I dedicated my thesis to answer two questions: How do women participate in democratization? How does democratization affect the lives of women? I use two case studies: socialist Spain in the post-Franco years starting in 1975 and neoliberal Argentina after the Dirty War, beginning in 1982. I argue that although the Argentine women demonstrated a greater activism in the transitional phase of democratization, the Spanish women have received more benefits in the consolidation phase. I conclude that both the women's involvement and the effects of democratization on their lives depend on the social, political, and economic contexts surrounding this process.

For Keats the day-to-day actions of Shakespeare\'s life rise to the level of allegory precisely because Shakespeare exists for us primarily in his dramatic poetry - in the language of his characters. Keats pursues an understanding of Shakespeare\'s poetic mind through an intense study of his characters and poetry; by habitually immersing himself in Shakespeare\'s art, Keats hopes to achieve for himself the poetic dexterity which allows Shakespeare to exist through the lives of his creations. By exploring Shakespeare\'s plays, particularly A Midsummer Night\'s Dream and A Winter\'s Tale, two plays that Keats alludes to in some of his greatest poems, we can gain further understanding of the tension and pursuits within Keats\'s own poems, and see how his development as a poet was shaped by his predecessor.

Since the overthrow of President Mobutu Sese Seka in 1997, a bitter civil war involving several African nations has eaten away at the structure of the state and plunged the nation further into chaos. The current state of the country has its roots in the economic and political history of the Congo. At independence in 1960, the Congo descended into a long period of economic and political instability. An examination of this period is crucial to any understanding of the current situation. This discussion will highlight one actor in the Congo, the World Bank and present a chronology of the Bank's activities in the nation since 1960, the year of independence. The individual Bank projects, the ideology behind the Bank's involvement in the Congo, and the historical importance of the Bank in the Congo, relative to other actors, will be discussed in the framework of an economic history of the Congo.

In Japan, reformoriented intellectuals, often described by historians as ""fascists,"" led the country\'s search for a new order to overcome the depression. At the same time their contemporaries in America, the progressive architects of the welfare state and new liberalism, were engaged in the creation of the New Deal. Although their respective political orientations appear to be diametrical opposites, intellectuals in both countries shared similar ideas about reform through the power of the state based largely on their critique of capitalism and their experiences with economic mobilization during World War I. A comparison of their policies of economic and social policies reveals that, despite profound differences in cultural and political context, ""authoritarian"" Japan and ""liberal"" America developed remarkably similar responses to the depression.

","English The portrayal of Eve in John Milton's Paradise Lost has been interpreted in many controversial ways, with both misogynistic and feminist views. Not only have these views both been strongly supported, but also the social context in which these views were conveyed has given Eve a complex number of facets that have changed over time. Interpretation itself is not subject to any rigid structure; because of this, Eve's role in The Fall has been a controversial topic. However, by studying Milton's other works, looking at philosophical influences, and reading relevant excerpts from the Bible, Eve is redeemed. Through the reinterpretation of Milton's description of Eve, it is clear that he portrayed the feminist view of an independent woman who executed her actions intentionally and deliberately.

However, there is little analysis as to why the West enfranchised women before the East. The work that has been done on the West has looked at suffrage from an isolationist viewpoint. Western states have either been studied individually or as a collective group with little respect to what was occurring in the East at the same time.

Once trapped, the objects can be held for observation, moved or collided with other trapped objects without damaging or contaminating samples. In order to study physical interactions quantitatively, one must first have a good calibration of the trapping force. Our optical tweezers have computer-controlled manipulation of the sample position which allows us to calibrate the horizontal trapping forces using the known fluid drag forces. Vertical trapping forces will be measured by varying the power of the laser. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.) ",2001,Physics,Physics

Coleman, Chemistry ","Electronic energy transfer between transition metal ions is a common phenomenon in the solid state and in solution. This communication between molecules by energy transfer produces a number of effects, including the broadening of spectral transitions. However, it is difficult to determine if the cause of a particular broadening is due to energy transfer. Measuring the spectra in dilute solution or in doped solids is frequently inconclusive due to the formation of aggregates resulting in proximity of the metal ions. Our work takes a different approach to address this question. We dissolve complexes of Cr (III), a d3 system, in various plastic matrices, and then use emission spectroscopy to test for energy transfer. The emission of these complexes arises from the 'E\xf4\x80\x84\x8b4A, transition, and should be quite sharp in the absence of energy transfer. We will present data on the synthesis of the matrices, the temperature dependence of the emission spectra and the dependence of emission lifetime on metal ion concentration in the matrix in an effort to determine whether or not cooperative interactions exist in the complexes of Cr (III) with delocalized ligands such as 2,4- pentanedione.

A .-hairpin, the most basic structural element of an anti-parallel .-sheet, is a secondary structure that is currently not well understood. Secondary structure formation is maintained by multiple complex intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding. In this study, a 12-residue peptide with a thioamide in place of an amide was synthesized and the consequent effect on secondary structure formation was investigated. The increased acidity of the thioamide, observed by its lower pKa, enables the alpha nitrogen to more readily donate its proton for hydrogen bonding. The thioamide substitution should thus strengthen the hydrogen bonding between the two strands of the ,hairpin and increase the stability of the structure.

637,2001,The Evolution of Postcranial Morphology in Delphinoidea,"Stephanie Anne Schur '01, Paleobiology "," Emily Buchholtz, Biological Sciences ","Living delphinoid cetaceans display a range of swimming styles. Skeletal characteristics of fast and sustained swimmers within this group include discoidal torso vertebrae with elevated metapophyses and anteriorly inclined neural processes, tailstock vertebrae with elongate centra and anteriorly inclined neural arches and high vertebral counts. Simple physical models indicate a causal relationship between these osteological characteristics and decreased body flexibility. Fluke aspect ratio evidence strongly supports the correlation between powerful swimming and rigidity of the vertebral column. The ratio of the fluke span to surface area allows estimates of dorsal-ventral recoil during swimming. Higher aspect ratio flukes, modest recoil and efficient energy use characterize derived, powerful swimmers. Trait polarization by reference to living nondelphinoid odontocetes and fossil delphinoids allows a preliminary reconstruction of the historical sequence of evolutionary innovations responsible for character distribution among living species. Times of character innovation can be constrained using exceptional fossils.

638,2001,The Impostor Phenomenon and Level of Voice: Gender Differences in Distress over Inauthenticity,"Amy L. Gower '01, Psychology and Women's and Gender Studies "," Julie K. Norem, Psychology ","Two related constructs in psychology focus on whether people feel they are being ""real"" in their interactions. The ""Impostor Phenomenon,"" refers to feelings that one has fooled others into believing that one is competent. ""Loss of Voice"" refers to when people feel unable to express their feelings and opinions freely. These two constructs are similar in their hypothesized societal and familial origins, but have yielded conflicting results with respect to gender. This study was designed to explore the relationship between the Impostor Phenomenon, Loss of Voice, psychological masculinity and femininity and a newly developed measure of distress concerning inauthenticity in interpersonal relationships. Two hundred men and women completed this set of measures. We hypothesize that differences in psychological masculinity and femininity, more than gender alone, will be related to impostor feelings and loss of voice. Because feminine values include authenticity in relationships, feminine individuals should experience greater conflict over authenticity. ",2001,Psychology,Psychology

640,2001,The Sculpture of Evelyn Beatrice Longman,"Margaret Samu '01, Art History and French "," Rebecca Bedell, Art ","Students walking through the main entrance to Clapp Library every day may not realize that they are passing the bronze doors made by Evelyn Beatrice Longman, a prominent early-twentieth-century American sculptor. Longman (1874-1954) was the first woman sculptor to become a full member of the National Academy of Design. In publications of her day, she was hailed as one of the most successful women sculptors and was compared favorably against the men with whom she competed for commissions. Despite her prominence during her lifetime, she has been virtually ignored in contemporary scholarly literature. Researching how Longman received commissions for large-scale public monuments reveals how she was able to establish a professional reputation in a male-dominated art world. Examining her work within its art historical context shows how the tension between modernism and traditionalism, as well as changing beliefs about the role of public sculpture, have affected how her work is remembered today.

One form of memory is priming. Priming refers to an increased ability to identify a stimulus, such as a word or picture, after previously being exposed to that stimulus. It has been assumed that priming is beneficial because of the improvement in identifying stimuli as a result of this prior exposure. Recent research using a perceptual identification test has suggested that priming may not be solely facilitative, but instead may entail costs as well as benefits. This study will investigate how different experimental manipulations affect the cost and benefit in priming. The results will demonstrate whether the same underlying memory systems support the cost and benefit, or whether there are separate cognitive mechanisms supporting the cost and benefit in priming.

Emotional Instability was defined in terms of a propensity to experience negative affect and have problems with impulse control. Because participants in this study were born in the 1920s and reached adolescence in the 1930s and 1940s, a time when gender expectations differed for men and women, Emotional Instability had different life-course implications for emotionally unstable boys and girls. A history of adolescent Emotional Instability for men manifested itself in lower economic attainment in older age. In contrast, emotionally unstable girls had problems with interpersonal relations and lower life satisfaction scores later in life. Comparisons of emotionally unstable individuals who decreased in emotional instability with age (improvers) with individuals who remained high in emotionally instability throughout their lives (nonchangers) will also be discussed.

I predict there will be an interaction such that more satisfying relationships will protect against depressive symptoms for those who are psychologically feminine, those with a relational orientation and Asian Americans. However, for those who are psychologically masculine, those with a personal orientation and European Americans, I predict there will be no relationship or a significantly weaker relationship between quality of relationships and depressive symptoms.

The text's foreign language and its expression of ways of thinking strange to us complicate the challenge of understanding its message. But the inherent biological importance of Eros makes his influence and origin interesting and opens access to notions presented by Plato's speakers. The process of translating and interpreting the original Greek is made difficult by the distance of ancient ideas, vocabulary and behaviors but is encouraged by the presence of steadfast, common tendencies and values. Phaedrus' encomium, for example, attributes the noblest human courage to love's inspiration - an idea that may be familiar from contemporary suggestions in literature and our own experiences. Then, perhaps un-familiarly, the speakers regarded love as a deity. Phaedrus praises him as one of the oldest gods, and observes that the other gods honor those who demonstrate his inspiration. These are more foreign conceptions that, along with the new words that Plato uses to present them, offer a more involved challenge to understanding. ",2001,Greek,Classical Studies

The economic efficiencies of laws banning same-sex marriages are examined using a cost-benefit analysis.

Turbak, Computer Science ","Designing programs around the natural decomposition of a problem into modules makes it easier for programmers to write and maintain programs. This principle is known as modularity. Despite the benefits of modularity, it introduces inefficiency into programs, in part due to the creation of intermediate data structures such as lists and trees. Deforestation is a program transformation that eliminates some of these structures, allowing programmers to write modular programs with reckless abandon and still enjoy the efficiency benefits of monolithic programming. ', ""Most existing deforestation algorithms require the input program to be in a restricted form in order to ensure that deforestation occurs. Olaf Chitil has recently developed a type-inference-based algorithm for deforestation, which removes some of these restrictions. Chitil has also developed a prototype that partially implements this algorithm. This prototype requires more development in order to test it on example programs. This year I am working on developing the tools necessary to test the prototype, with the goal of fully implementing Chitil's algorithm.

There are 14 cysteines in the protein, three of which are thought to be located near the active site. Disulfide bridges involving these three cysteines are believed to block substrate access to the active site. In the presence of thiol reagents, an increase in enzyme activity is observed. A triple mutant, in which the three active site cysteines have been replaced by serines, is 20 times more active than the wildtype. However, we have found that other, possibly surface, cysteine residues are responsible for aggregation and precipitation of the protein. Exhaustive alkylation of the surface cysteines produces wildtype and mutant enzymes ten-fold more active than the unmodified wild-type protein. However, the activity is still lower than that of the unmodified mutant. This implies that optimal activity occurs when the three cysteines near the active site are reduced, while other cysteines are not.

Adenosine deaminase (ADA) is a purine catabolic enzyme that controls adenosine levels. Consequently, ADA-deficient mice develop severe asthma in association with elevated adenosine. Systemic ADA enzyme therapy can prevent severe asthma in this model by lowering adenosine levels. It is not known, however, whether this effect is a consequence of lowering local or systemic levels of adenosine. To address this, both injection and inhalation routes of ADA delivery were compared. It was shown that intranasally administered ADA lowered lung adenosine levels. Furthermore, the intranasally administered ADA remained localized to the lung. This study suggests that inhalation of ADA will be sufficient to produce similar effects as seen with the injection of ADA, only with local effects. (Research supported by a Zimmermann grant.)

Wolfson, Chemistry, Jeffrey A. Sigman, Chemistry ","The enzyme EC 3.4.24.15 (EP 24.15) binds and cleaves peptides of 20 amino acids or less. Possible endogenous substrates for the enzyme include bradykinin, gonadotropin releasing hormone and neurotensin. In the laboratory, activity of EP 24.15 is most easily monitored using quenched fluorescent substrates. Previous studies have shown that in the optimal pH range for the enzyme (from 7.0 to 8.0), hydrolysis of substrate is enhanced by the addition of manganese or calcium ions. In an effort to determine the nature of the interaction between the divalent metals, protein and/or substrate, we have determined kinetic parameters for the protein over a wide pH range with and without the addition of Mn(II) and Ca(II). The metals both enhance binding and increase maximal velocity. These observations suggest that the effect of metal ions may be due in part to their substitution for protons involved in binding substrate.

The sample included 31 children from a laboratory preschool in a suburban area of the United States. Children were asked to choose between paired photographs of ""more active"" activities versus ""less active"" activities. Additionally, the children\'s mothers completed surveys to provide a measure of maternal attitudes towards and participation in physical activity. The hypothesis was that boys would prefer more physical activities than girls would, and that girls\' preferences would be more influenced by their mothers\' attitudes towards exercise than would boys\' activity choices. Results of the picture task and mother survey did not support either hypothesis. On the picture task, girls chose active objects more often than boys, but the difference was not significant. The mothers\' activity levels, as indicated by their responses on the survey, did not relate to the activity levels of their children. Furthermore, there was no interaction between gender and mother\'s activity level as predictors of child\'s activity preference. These results suggest that the pattern of maternal differential reinforcement for their children\'s physical activity is not universal or perhaps does not exist.

The two were depicted as being involved in a romantic relationship. The results indicated that the manipulation of success was the determining factor in how the target female was perceived. When paired with a high success male companion in either grooming category, the female was perceived less self-confident, less intelligent and less successful than when paired with a low success male partner. However, the male's high success positively radiated to perceptions of the female target as more socially aware and approachable.

708,2001,Dead Space to Community Place: The Lessons of Two Vernacular Architecture Projects in Houston and New York,"Kathryn E. O'Rourke '02, Architecture and English "," Alice T. Friedman, Art ","With an interest in the vital role of architecture, landscape and place creation in shaping the life and character of a neighborhood, and in forming individual and cultural identity, this paper considers the impact of two urban projects that integrate art, architecture and community revitalization. Project Row Houses in Houston and the casitas of New York City are different attempts at physical and social change in an urban environment. They offer important lessons for architects, planners and politicians who seek to affect change in some of the most depressed communities in the United States. Project Row Houses, the result of the vision of artist Rick Lowe, is a series of 22 shotgun houses that have been renovated and put to new use in Houston's Third Ward, a predominately African American, low-income community. Dilapidated and essentially abandoned when he first saw them, the houses have been transformed, through volunteer efforts and private donations, into installation art spaces, houses for young single mothers and classrooms for children. Building on the vision of the African American community portrayed in the work of painter John Biggers, Lowe's combination of art, housing and enrichment programming for local children is unique and successful. The casitas of New York are small, wooden, brightly painted houses that function as community centers in the Lower East Side, East Harlem, the South Bronx and Brooklyn. They closely resemble domestic vernacular architecture of Puerto Rico and have been built by Puerto Rican immigrants. They are usually accompanied by a garden and are on lots owned by the city but that have been functionally abandoned and left to go to waste. Each casita is different, but all are maintained by the casita members who come from the neighborhood, and in some cases distant neighborhoods, to use them. Many casitas and gardens have been Jost to development and many more are threatened as real estate values, particularly in the Lower East Side, escalate. This paper examines the lessons of Project Row Houses and the casitas from an architectural and urban planning standpoint. Among the issues considered are the link between place and cultural identity, the importance of nature in an urban setting, the role of art in people's lives and the need for diversity in an urban landscape. The project includes information gained from site visits and interviews in Houston and throughout New York, as well as readings in the architectural history of the pertinent forms, urban theory and planning and environmental psychology.

Though the French describe themselves as accepting of their North African neighbors and tolerant of their customs and beliefs, in fact, these sentiments are rarely in evidence. From their perspective, in order to prosper, these newcomers must embrace French customs and ideals. Indeed, the French express little or no interest in adapting, even passively, to ', '""Muslim ways."" While the North Africans are convinced that conforming to French culture ""in its entirety"" is the only strategy whereby they can avoid being ""ghettoized,"" they appear unwilling to sacrifice even minor Islamic customs and surround themselves almost exclusively with those of their own immigrant group.

Estimates of deaths in the USSR from executions, forced relocations, planned famines and brutal work camps exceed 20 million people and, for some, constitute genocide. Yet many intellectuals denied, excused or otherwise justified the USSR\'s tactics in an effort to preserve Marxist ideology. The later works of prominent labor historians Sidney and Beatrice Webb are a case study in Communist apologetics. Webb\'s case exemplifies a potential danger with ""armchair utopia-seekers"" who attempt to use their prestige to support political movements.

Since SF\xe2\x80\xa2 and fluoropolymers are used together in high voltage environments, it has been postulated that SF,CF, is a product of the reaction between SF, and \xe2\x80\xa2CF, radicals. Our experimental procedure involves low-energy ( < 50 eV) electron irradiation of nanoscale thin films (- 10A thickness) of CF3I and SF5Cl grown at 100 K on a molybdenum single crystal in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber (p - 5 x 10\xc2\xb711 Torr).

Upon electron irradiation of SF5Cl thin films, \xe2\x80\xa2SF and \xe2\x80\xa2SF, radical formation has been observed. Once we establish \xe2\x80\xa2SF, radical production, we will probe the electron-induced reactions in mixed multilayers of the two reactant gases CF,! and SF5Cl. If we are successful in producing SF,CF,, our findings will suggest that it is the low-energy secondary electrons found in high-voltage environments that initiate the reactions leading to SF,CF, greenhouse gas formation.

The fascination with consumer goods and an increasing reverence for popular cultural idols was a central concern of a group of sociologists who are known collectively as the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory. The Frankfurt School represented an attempt to reconstitute Marxism in light of the horrors of World War I and the rise of fascism in Europe. They viewed the rise of popular culture as a new form of domination. As a means to liberation, Frankfurt School theorists implored audiences to interrogate rather than passively accept visual culture and to view mass culture critically as a new instrument of cultural domination and enslavement.

Poetry, as a medium, encounters unique problems when it is translated because of its inherent formal and acoustic constraints. Rhyme and meter continue to be integral parts of Russian poetry throughout the twentieth century, long after English-language poetry dismisses these concerns. This emphasis on form, perhaps due to the innate rhyming structure of the Russian language, puts severe constraints on the translator of Russian poetry. I look at what aspects can be discarded, if at all, in a translation, and also suggest methods of adding to the original in order to enhance the poetic experience. I will make use of multimedia devices to transform the reader into a viewer, engaging sight and hearing by juxtaposing Russian and English renderings of selected poetry, conjoined with well-known classical Russian music.

This uncritical association naturalizes certain categories of identity and difference and obscures the arbitrariness of the social relations that these uphold.

Even law enforcement agencies fail to recognize hate crimes against the transgendered community by either not recording incidents as hate crimes or by misrepresenting the victims as homosexual. As a result, transgendered victims are virtually absent from hate crime statistics.

Reactions in vitro show proliferation of CDS + T cells after treatment with DCs and apoptotic cells. Cytotoxic lysis assays of these killer T cells exhibited antigen specific lysis of target cells. These results, along with immunoassays of cytokine release, suggest that although induction of killer T cells occurs, proliferation of activated cells may result in a minor immune response.

One of the most exciting discoveries in neuroscience in the last decade is that neurons in the adult nervous system do have some capacity for proliferation. This discovery has spawned extensive research into the multitude of factors that control cell birth (neurogenesis) and cell death. In this session, we will explore neuronal birth and death in invertebrate and vertebrate animal models.

Therefore, we are working on various strategies utilizing C-3 S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles. Once the ribose group is added on to 1,2,4-triazole (1) at the desired N-4 position, we will then remove the C-3 substituent to obtain our desired product.

A modified version of TOP, with one negatively\xc2\xadcharged amino acid residue changed to a neutral one, was found to have decreased activity toward natural substrates but increased activity toward artificial substrates. This suggested that the negative residue is in the binding site of the enzyme, interfering with the binding of negatively-charged groups on the artificial substrate but essential for binding positively-charged groups on the natural substrate. We have previously shown that positively-charged metal ions increase TOP's activity toward artificial substrates, perhaps by neutralizing the charge on either substrate or enzyme. In testing the activity of the enzyme in the presence of these metal ions, both the natural and modified enzymes had increased activity toward the artificial substrate and decreased activity toward the natural substrate.

The triazole nitrogen can act as a nucleophile to attack either alkyl groups or halogens to yield the triazolium ion. A nucleophile can then add to the adjacent carbon in the triazole ring, to give the CS-substituted triazole or triazoline.

Unlike most enzymes, it is activated by dithio\xc2\xadthreitol (OTT), an agent which breaks S-S bonds. These bonds are formed by neighboring cysteine residues. TOP contains several cysteine residues on its surface, and the enzyme can form dimers when S\xc2\xadS bonds form between them. When this happens, activity is lower. Several mutant forms of TOP have been made in which either one or two of these surface cysteines have been mutated so as to prevent S-S bond formation. Two of the mutants (one with modification at Cys 46 and one with modification at Cys 682 and 687) were separated into their monomeric and dimeric form and the activity was tested. The results indicate that dimerization through one side of the enzyme decreases its activity, while dimerization through the opposite side has little effect.","2002, 2004",Biological Chemistry,"Chemistry, Chemistry"

The prices are much higher than world prices, meaning that consumers and taxpayers transfer huge sums to farmers annually. After World War II, fresh memories of shortages and starvation motivated this plan to ensure supply, but today there is no longer a need to promote self-sufficiency at such a cost. The CAP is an outdated policy that threatens the EU\'s future. The budgetary pressures of the CAP must be sharply reduced before the EU enlarges to the east. If the CAP is not drastically reformed, the EU will not be able to afford to fully integrate the new members into the EU. Excluding the new members from the CAP will set a dangerous precedent of ""Europe a la carte,"" which will result in increased instability and internal conflict. ",2002,French,Economics

It is, however, at the cost of highly volatile exchange rates, particularly at short-term horizons. Short-term exchange rate behavior has remained a puzzle in international finance. This paper constructs a theoretical model that combines models from the finance and economics literature to explain empirical findings. The model evolves from a multi\xc2\xadfactor affine model, applies the pricing kernel hypothesis to exchange rate movement in continuous-time form, and discusses the special cases where two countries have symmetric/asymmetric mutual influences. Employing continuous\xc2\xadtime framework and allowing for asymmetric interaction cross the border, the new exchange rate model is able to show that the forward premium anomaly is indeed normal and that non-linearities in exchange rate behavior can result from country asymmetry.

The U.S. anti-dumping law serves as a protective measure that can impose tariffs and quotas on foreign firms whose goods injure U.S. producers. Unfortunately, the current anti-dumping regulations discriminate against foreign firms by punishing them for practices American firms themselves employ and which deprive consumers of the benefits of free trade. We focus our analysis on a specific 1998 ITC trade dispute in which two U.S. manufacturers of Elastic Rubber Tape (for use mostly in leg openings, waists and trimming in swimsuits and underwear) filed a dumping complaint against an Indian competitor. Fortunately, the ITC did not rule in favor of the U.S. petitioners, but it employed legal rather than economic reasoning in reaching its decision.

This paper is an analysis of multiculturalism as a discourse and how the institutional structures and modes of subjectivity that this discourse creates influence individual self-identity. Drawing on ethnographic research and interviews with Mexican-descent students at Wellesley College, this paper explores how campus-wide discourses of multiculturalism constitute students' experiences of self by defining the categories of difference through which self-identity becomes articulated. I argue that multiculturalism, as understood by most Wellesley students, establishes categories of difference founded on racial and ethnic variables that force students to identify themselves with one of these categories.

The difference between the policies and practices towards the disabled community represent an often-ignored inconsistency. Some bioethicists believe this inconsistency is necessary to maintain social justice while others criticize it as erosion of social justice. The latter view is supported by the historical example of the human rights atrocities of the 1930s eugenics movement. Selective abortion and eugenics, however, have fundamental differences that enable mainstream bioethicists to argue that preventing the birth of disabled people is a moral obligation to society. The social justifications for selective abortion are based on the belief that disability is a burden on society. This thesis deconstructs this view by showing that the social justification of selective abortion is misinformed and a morally unacceptable attitude. ",2002,Psychology,Women's and Gender Studies

Lowered GABAergic activity is associated with improved memory, and enrichment is associated with synaptic sprouting, which may result from reduced GABAergic inhibition. Therefore, we hypothesized that enrichment would be associated with lowered GAD activity and increased synaptophysin levels.

By analyzing the political activities of women at the local and national levels, the research focuses on Costa Rican women's struggles to legitimate their political voices and to advocate for social justice. The degree to which Costa Rican women can access their country's political system - as voters, as professionals, as activists and as volunteers - reveals how they may or may not benefit from their citizenship in a democratic state. Under consideration are the conditions under which Costa Rican women organize politically, the efforts of the Costa Rican state to facilitate women's political participation, and whether or not deliberate government attention to women's needs undermines or strengthens their presence in public life.

At an even more basic level, contributions to public goods raise fundamental questions about the nature of human beings - are they cooperative or selfish? We use laboratory experiments involving groups of subjects to address some of these questions. We show that contributions to public goods are based on the expectation that other members of society would contribute as well. Using a psychological trust scale, we find that there is a positive correlation between one's trust score and one's contribution. We also find that contributions are significantly higher when the feedback regarding group contributions is provided intermittently than when feedback is continuous.

Individuals who score high on internal-external congruence should score high on measures of personal identity and private self-consciousness and low on measures of social identity and public self-consciousness. Individuals who score low on internal-external congruence should show the opposite pattern of scores on the self-concept measures. High internal-external congruence individuals should also score high on individuation and feminist attitudes but low on measures of self-presentation. High congruence should correspond to high scores on the Independence Personal Values Scale.

914,2002,Body Blame: The Impact of Sexual Harassment on Victim Attributions of Blame and Coping Style,"Kristen Fay '02, Psychology"," Linda Carli, Psychology","Past studies of sexual harassment have addressed physical and psychological consequences, but limited research has focused on the association between sexual harassment and disordered eating in women. Literature reveals that sexual harassment has predictive power for eating and body image disturbance in women, but fails to include potential mediating factors to buffer such adverse outcomes. Studies have confirmed that using eating as a coping strategy to avoid or control negative emotions is linked to poorer overall psychological adjustment. Thus it seems likely that maladaptive coping strategies may mediate the psychological distress associated with sexual harassment and the onset of eating disorders. Moreover, the attributions made following the unwanted sexual advances have important implications for buffering adverse consequences in women. Studies have revealed that women who perceive discrimination experience harm to their psychological well being. They may cope with these negative consequences by increasing their gender group identification and adopting more liberal (feminist) attitudes and behaviors. Based on the arguments presented thus far, 1 am predicting and testing a path model that sexual harassment will predict psychological distress but will be mediated by type of coping strategy, attributions of blame, and gender identification. Eating will be seen as a specific and maladaptive coping strategy that also mediates this relationship.

Nuclear power generation, requiring minimal inputs yet providing the desired amount of electric power, met the needs of Japan's growing industry and population. Japan has become wedded to this production method, investing in its development and encouraging its use through the East Asian region. The nation has become so dependent on nuclear-generated power, that the construction and operation of nuclear power plants is extensive. However, the construction of these plants is not geographically widespread. Japan chose to build their plants in clusters, a phenomenon not found in other nuclear-dependent nations. The concentration of these plants is not haphazard but does hint at the urgency with which Japan developed it's nuclear program. Given time, this style of utility organization may influence nuclear plant construction worldwide. ",2002,International Relations,Economics
917,2002,A Mechanism for Hypoxia-Induced Activation of Cardiac KATP Channels in Goldfish,"Kristin Hoffmann '02, Neuroscience"," John S. Cameron, Biological Sciences","Previous studies have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in vertebrate cardiac muscle are activated during periods of decreased oxygen availability. The opening of this ion channel in the heart plays a protective role; however, the precise mechanism by which this occurs is unclear. I studied cardiac channel activation in a hypoxia-tolerant species, the goldfish (Carassius auratus), focusing on the potential role of nitric oxide (NO) in this process. Moderate, substrate-free hypoxia resulted in a shortening of ventricular action potential duration, a response that was blocked by the KATP channel antagonist BDM. In single-channel studies, increased KATP channel activity during hypoxia was abolished by BDM and the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ, but mimicked by a cGMP analog. These results suggest that KATP channels in goldfish heart are activated by hypoxia-induced NO release and the subsequent rise in cGMP levels.

One model suggests that a warming climate will stimulate microbial activity and increase nutrient availability in tundra ecosystems. We investigated how 11 years of experimental nutrient enrichment (N plus P fertilization) of wet sedge plots at the Toolik Lake LTER site on the North Slope of Alaska is influencing species composition and seasonal biomass accumulation. We estimated aboveground biomass of dominant species using regression analyses that predict species biomass from frequencies of point frame hits across the growing season. The N plus P fertilization increased aboveground biomass by a factor of 3.6 and dramatically altered species composition. N plus P additions also increased the amount of standing litter, lowered soil temperature, and reduced thaw depth. Long-term fertilization, therefore, impacts wet sedge tundra communities both directly and indirectly. ",2002,Biological Science,Biological Sciences

But these reports seem to fly in the face of statistical trends that suggest the rates of school violence have been relatively stable since they began to be collected on a national level in the ', 'mid-l 970s. Even more interesting is the fact that these same statistics suggest that school violence is not, and never was, a purely urban phenomenon, even though popular media have characterized it in this way.

Our results show public advice generates a process of social learning that increases contributions over time while reduci.ng free riding.

Such development will most certainly affect the surrounding ecosystems and could be extremely detrimental to the pristine coral reef of the area. Many coral reef areas within the TCI have already been declared marine protected areas (MPAs), but governments are constantly revising these decisions. It is important to establish an accurate and comprehensive economic value of the coral reef so that it can be used in cost-benefit analysis, which is used by governments when determining whether an area should become or remain an MPA. For the studied MPA, several methods were used to determine this value, including the Atlantic and Gulf Rapid Reef Assessment protocol (AGRRA), the contingent valuation method, and the travel-cost method.

Particles form long chains parallel to the electric field, causing the viscosity of the suspensions to increase by as much as several orders of magnitude. My research uses Matlab computer simulations to study electrorheological fluids under a steady shear-flow. The simulations model the behavior of the suspended particles as a result of varied particle spinning rates, particle size, relaxation times, and shearflow strength. Results indicate that average stress varies substantially as a function of particle spinning. In addition, for high shear and for low tilt angles, the simulations suggested that the onset of an electric field will cause the viscosity of the suspension to decrease.

In pursuit of this goal, the ILO has generated more than 184 conventions on various aspects of work. Yet, despite efforts to match the generation of conventions to the changing exigencies of capitalist production, the idea of what constitutes a \'worker\' has remained largely static. By conducting a critical examination of the ILO\'s 184 conventions, my research reveals that only modest changes have occurred in the way in which ""worker"" is conceived within the ILO. This paper, by analyzing ILO conventions across four periods, traces not only the relatively static nature of this definition, but also the social forces that have underpinned its (lack of) development. The paper concludes with an exploration of the implications of such a lack of development at the outset of the twenty-first century.

Among other objections, such initiatives were often accused of being coercive. A coercive proposal is usually defined as a threat that diminishes an agent's freedom of choice to the point that her subsequent action is said to be forced or involuntary. Offers like birth control incentive programs, however, provide an agent with options she previously did not have.

However, as feminist groups gained support and momentum, the concept of abortion as a woman's right emerged. Because many legislatures were resistant to change, advocates abandoned the strategy of seeking policy change through the legislatures and catapulted the issue into the courts, arguing that by denying access to abortion, states were abridging women's constitutional rights. The momentous ruling of Roe u. Wade in 1973 established a strict scrutiny standard for statutes limiting abortion access. However, the constitutional right to abortion was subsequently eroded most notably by the 1992 Planned Parenthood u.

1047,2003,"Woman, Writer, Critic: Jane Austen's Authorship and Late Eighteenth-Century English Society","Meryl Rosen '03, English"," Yoon Sun Lee, English","In late eighteenth-century England, women were depended upon to accept their roles as domestic figureheads by fulfilling their obligations as wives and mothers. The female sphere was decidedly fixed in substance and scope, and pressing beyond its borders would not only jeopardize definitions of sexual difference but also threaten the social structure on which matters of ideology, politics, wealth, and property rested. By writing professionally, woman writers risked an internal confusion over their place in a disapproving world and a struggle with self-acceptance amidst a conservative social climate. Still, a wealth of woman's writing emerged - most noticeably in the rich novels of Jane Austen. Often overlooked in Austen's fiction is its subtle yet biting social critique, criticism which mirrors the author's personal conflicts on account of her gender. Thus, the difficult social position of late eighteenth-century English women can be described in greater detail as we delve into Jane Austen's personal and professional lives - and their fascinating intersection.

They are capable of producing a wide variety of sounds - squeaks, whistles, clicks, and grunts. Several papers have been written on the differences in calls produced by different familial groups of both resident and transient killer whales but calls could not be attributed to individual whales within these families. The goal of my research has been to process a large collection of recorded sounds into a collection of individual whale calls. In 1998, Dr. Patrick Miller of Woods Hole recorded a large number of calls from Northern resident whales living off the coast of British Columbia. He used an array of sixteen hydrophones so that the origin of a particular call can be found by measuring the distance between the call and each of the hydrophones. Combining this information with the visual data about the positions of whales around the boat, we can isolate calls to specific whales. Dr. Miller has written a set of computer programs that combine the acoustic recordings and surface locations into a visual spectrogram, where the calls appear as bright red or yellow marks on a blue background. These calls can then be digitally cut from the recording and modeled quantitatively using a pitch contour program developed for the human voice. All processed calls are then compiled in a corpus of killer whale calls. Hopefully in the future this data can be analyzed to understand more closely the interactions of killer whales.

However, if the trend seen locally holds for more distant quasars as well, host galaxies should increase in luminosity. To constrain these models, we needed to observe quasars at much greater distances than was previously possible. We have used the 6.5m Magellan telescope in Chile to obtain infrared images of eight quasars at a cosmological redshift of four.

1101,2004,Painting to Be Constructed in Your Head: Yoko Ono's Instruction Paintings,"Sarah Stone '04, Art History"," Patricia Berman, Art","In the 1950s and '60s, Yoko Ono created a series of conceptual art projects consisting of brief , poem-like instructions. Presented in the form of written scores with or without accompanying manipulable objects, these instructions are open-ended and ambiguous in meaning. The Instruction Paintings reinterpreted the dynamic, transformative meanings of Marcel Duchamp 's readymades, John Cage's experimental scores, and Ono's understandings of Zen Buddhist traditions. The Instruction Paintings direct viewers to interact with the world around them in unexpected ways, creating a space for reflection that questions the distinctions among philosophy , art, and life. Despite the simplicity of the instructions, interacting with Ono's work  can be a startling and liberating experience. Spectators will be offered  the chance to perform  some of these works in order to explore their participatory, yet ultimately introspective nature, and to examine Ono's contributions to Conceptual Art.

Most RTT cases are associated with mutations to the X-linked gene encoding MeCP2 , a transcriptional repressor.

1165,2005,Nonpeptide Agonists of Insulin Induction,Meghan Hogan,David R. Haines,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36) amide (GLP-1) is an agonist which binds to a pancreatic G protein coupled receptor, initiating insulin production, and thereby mediating the blood glucose levels of the body. The N-terminal histidine residue of GLP-1 is essential for activation of the target receptor (GLP-1R). The CCK inhibitor T-0632 inhibits the binding of GLP-1 to GLP-1R. Binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R involves residues of GLP-1R which are known to be required for activation. We are investigating the use of T-0632 as a nonpeptide delivery agent for small molecule agonists, such as histidine, to the activation site of the receptor. Preliminary results of biological screening will be reported.",2006,Biological Chemistry ,Chemistry

Exendin-4 (Ex-4), a 39 residue peptide found in Gila monster venom, was found to be an agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Data from binding and activation assays of GLP-1 point mutants suggest that GLP-1 and Ex-4 have distinct and discrete receptor, activating regions and receptor-binding regions. We are examining the separability of these functions by truncating Ex-4 at the N-terminus and using a nonpeptide attachment to connect model small agonists to the binding region. The first agonists studied use the natural N-terminal tripeptide molecule to show that we can preserve activation with such an attachment.

Previous amino acid substitutions of this histidine with lysine and with alanine have been interpreted to indicate the requirement for a positively charged residue in the N-terminal position. To further develop the structure-activity relationship for the interaction of the N-terminal amino acid of GLP-1 with GLP-1R, histidine analogs such as 1-imidazolyl-alanine (1), have been synthesized via Michael addition to an acrylic acid ester.

1170,2005,Synthesis and Strategies for the Enantiomeric Resolution of T-0632,Julia Lin,David R. Haines,"Studies have shown that peptide GLP-1 induces the production of insulin in the human body as it binds and activates the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), making it a promising method of treatment for diabetes mellitus. However, GLP-1 is short lived in vivo, thus it is necessary to find binding, nonpeptide small molecule activators of GLP-1R. Although the non peptide antagonist T-0632 (1) inhibits the release of insulin, the selective binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R makes T-0632 a potential lead compound for diabetes treatment. We have developed an efficient synthesis of racemic T-0632. The resolution of T-0632 enantiomers has been attempted in two synthetic strategies via reaction with chiral alcohol to form diastereomers. Further details of the synthesis and chiral resolution will be discussed. (Research supported by the Merck SURF Program.)",2007,Chemistry,Chemistry

It is suspected that TOP can metabolize an unusually wide range of substrates due to a flexible binding loop. In our study, small glycine (Gly) residues in the loop were replaced with larger, less flexible alanines (Ala). The activities of three mutants, Gly599Ala, Gly603Ala, and Gly604Ala, were compared to that of wild-type enzyme. All three enzymes had lower activity than wild-type towards a large substrate. However, towards a smaller substrate, Gly603Ala was the most active, surpassing even wild type. Gly604Ala had little activity towards either substrate. These results are consistent with earlier enzyme unfolding studies. Low concentrations of the denaturant urea led to lower activity of both wild type and mutant enzymes toward the smaller substrate, but increased activity towards the larger substrate.

The gold_sh (Carassius auratus), for example, can survive and remain active for as long as 5 days in water with no oxygen at all! Our overall hypothesis was that the activation of speci_c potassium ion channels in critical tissues is one factor that enhances survival under low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions in this species. We used intracellular recording techniques to characterize a hypoxia-induced increase in the activity of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) ion channels in the heart, to resolve the mechanism by which this change takes place, and speci_cally, to assess the role of nitric oxide (NO) in channel activation. During moderate hypoxia in tissue bath, KATP channels on the outer surface of cardiac muscle cells were activated. Our data support a role for NO in channel activation, potentially enhancing the tolerance of this species to environmental stress.

The fact is, nothing is wrong with the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, but unnatural amino acids have proven themselves to be extremely useful. When an amino acid is modified by thioxylation, in which the carbonyl oxygen is replaced by a sulfur atom, the resulting peptide may show an increase in enzymatic stability and potency, which would be helpful in designing drugs. We are inserting a thiomide linkage into a beta-hairpin to gain an understanding of how the secondary structure surrounding the thiomide is affected. This information is essential in order for thioxylated amino acids to be useful as tools in protein design, and in the study of the relation-ship between structure and function in proteins and peptides.

Previous research suggests that PATL1 is recruited to the expanding and maturing cell plate, where it is believed to serve a critical function. Approaches being taken to investigate protein interactions of two members of the patellin family, PATL1 and PATL2, include pull-down assays with clathrin and yeast two-hybrid screens.

1178,2005,It's Good to Be Flexible: Changes in Substrate Speci_city in Thimet Oligopeptidase ,Laura Stadelmann,Adele Wolfson,"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) hydrolyzes various peptides and regulates several neurological and physiological processes. A cleft separates the two domains of TOP and contains the substrate-binding pocket and active site. A loop region, which is thought to be quite flexible, connects the domains; changes in the loop may lead to modifications in substrate specificity. To trap intermediate conformations of the loop, glycine residues within the active site were replaced with larger, less flexible alanine residues. The activity of the mutants was compared to that of wild-type enzyme towards two quenched fluorescent substrates. All mutants had lower activity than wild type towards a natural substrate analog, but towards a smaller substrate one mutant had higher activity. These results are consistent with data that revealed increases in activity towards the larger substrate when the enzyme is partially denatured, and presumably more flexible, in addition to data revealing conformational changes under denaturing conditions.

Migrants have come and are still coming to the city, in hopes of a better life. Often they become inhabitants of disadvantaged neighborhoods, squatter settlements, and low-income areas. This winter I participated in the MIT-run SIGUS (Special Interest Group in Urban Settlement) workshop, which brought together a group of Architecture and Planning students from Boston and Lima, Peru, in order to analyze the social and physical development of four different low-income communities in Lima. We conducted family interviews in order to better understand important steps in the development of the settlements since 1968 when they were surveyed by then MIT professor John Turner. While placing the program in the context of my study abroad experiences, I will share some of our group as well as individual findings.

1196,2005,The City of Detroitês Rebirth: Mathematical Modeling of Urban Renewal,Garen S. Wolff ,William F. Coleman,"The city of Detroit is experiencing the nations largest modern day urban renewal. Since the 1920s, urban planners have drafted visions of the citys future. In the postwar period, their strategies for development, funding, and political leadership led to unanticipated consequences. Detroits lack of mass transportation and its economic instability are just two examples showing their plans were greatly flawed. Nonetheless, Detroit has emerged from its rut. Campus Martius, the Compuware headquarters, promises to foster commercial growth and bring new light on the nearly forgotten center of the city. The construction of the General Motors World Headquarters is projected to promote more business. Yet, as this city begins to flourish and approach economic stability, its capacity to efficiently carry or sustain a population with all its needs met, is a crucial question.

He delighted in the absurd humor of everyday life. His one-person vaudeville On the Harmful Effects of Tobacco is unapologetically absurd, and this humor is enhanced by the pathetic believability of its protagonist. For the very reasons they are considered works of beauty and genius, the plays of Anton Chekhov are a challenge both to translate and to perform. Often in translation, the beauty of his prose is sacrificed to render lines as natural and realistic as the originals, or else the speakability is sacrificed to preserve the poetry of the original. Both cases present their own challenges to the performer. In my translation of this play, I have attempted to find a point between realistic and beautiful language that does justice to the brilliant blending of the two in Chekhovs Russian.",2005,Russian Language and Literature,Russian

However, these ordinarily benign ideas become dangerous when they are manipulated for political purposes, invoked to challenge the security of others, and used to incite conflict. Reification of group boundaries and identities on the one hand and ethnic violence on the other become mutually reinforcing, as alterity promotes violence and violence promotes alterity. I seek to determine how the peace processes in Bosnia and Northern Ireland affected the character and quantity of alterity framed in terms of ethnic difference. Did the power-sharing agreements exacerbate ethnic difference and reify formerly fluid ethnic identities? Was clarification and separation of group identity necessary to maintain peace? Ultimately, I seek to examine the intended and unintended effects of these two peace agreements on ethnicity to better understand the limitations and possibilities of ethnic conflict resolution.",2005,Political Science and Anthropology,Anthropology

Leutert ,William Joseph,"As a subject for political science, the Hong Kong Legislative Council presents a unique and fascinating opportunity to study a political system in transition. What was once an appointed and solely advisory body under the British colonial system as recently as the 1980s has evolved in the modern context of Chinese sovereignty into todays legislature, which must now address compelling political questions about democratization, sovereignty, representation, and political party development. From the period of Christopher Pattens governorship in 1992-1997 to the recent ruling in April 2004 by the Standing Committee of the National Peoples Congress, key reforms and changes to the powers of the Legislative Council and to the body itself have had the ancillary effect of profoundly transforming Hong Kongs political culture. Since that time, a growing democratization movement has continued to contest the popular assumption that people in Hong Kong are only concerned with stability and prosperity, and it has challenged the Legislative Council to address a variety of fundamental political issues.

1209,2005,Examining the Phase Transition Behavior of N-Isopropylacrylamide Copolymer Hydrogels with In Situ-Generated Gold Nanoparticles,Frances Pong,Nolan T. Flynn,"Hydrogels are polymer networks that undergo stimuli-responsive volume phase transitions, in which the gels contract and expel their contents into their surroundings. Control of this behavior has prompted much research for use of hydro-gels as stimuli-responsive drug carriers. My research investigates two modifications of gel thermoresponsive phase transition: the variation of gel composition and the addition of in situ gold nanoparticles. Gels were synthesized using thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide as the polymer backbone and using 0.00-3.50% wt. of N,N-methylenebisacry-lamide (MBAm) and/or N,N-cystaminebisacrylamide (CBAm) as crosslinking agents, and were then embedded with in situ gold nanoparticles. UV spectroscopy revealed that the phase transitions of in situ gold samples with high concentrations of CBAm widened the most. Mass and diameter measurements of in situ gold gels with high concentrations of CBAm and low concentrations of MBAm were also substantially larger than gels that had lower concentrations of CBAm and/or higher concentrations of MBAm.

The electron-induced reactions of CF2Cl2/H2O _lms were designed to simulate CF2Cl2 absorbed on ice in the polar stratospheric clouds. Our methods include post-irradiation temperature programmed desorption (TPD) and electron stimulated desorption. Experiments were performed in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber, where CF2Cl2 thin _lms were grown at 100 K on a clean Mo(110) surface, or a Mo(110) surface with pre-adsorbed H2O. A mass spectrometer _lament was used to irradiate the thin _lms with low energy (5-100 eV) electrons.

1212,2005,Investigating the Role of Clb2 Subcellular Localization in Cell Cycle Regulation,Cortney Boulton,Jennifer Hood-DeGrenier,"The eukaryotic cell cycle is primarily regulated by cyclin-dependant kinases and the many cyclins that differentially associate with the kinases throughout the cell cycle. Subcellular localization of cyclins is known to be an important part of human cell cycle regulation. Previous work in our lab has suggested that cytoplasmic localization of the primary mitotic cyclin, Clb2, has a significant role in the regulation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle. I am interested in the function of Clb2 localization at the mother-bud neck, a site where regulatory proteins, including the kinase Swe1, are known to congregate. Cells depleted of cytoplasmic Clb2 were found to have elongated buds, which is characteristic of disrupted Swe1 regulation. This study is further investigating the role of Clb2 localization in Swe1 regulation and onset of mitosis.

1213,2005,Itês Good to Be Flexible: Changes in Substrate Speci_city in Thimet Oligopeptidase,Laura Stadelmann,Adele Wolfson,"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) hydrolyzes various peptides and regulates several neurological and physiological processes. A cleft separates the two domains of TOP and contains the substrate-binding pocket and active site. A loop region, which is thought to be quite flexible, connects the domains; changes in the loop may lead to modifications in substrate specificity. To trap intermediate conformations of the loop, glycine residues within the active site were replaced with larger, less flexible alanine residues. The activity of the mutants was compared to that of wild-type enzyme towards two quenched fluorescent substrates. All mutants had lower activity than wild type towards a natural substrate analog, but towards a smaller substrate one mutant had higher activity. These results are consistent with data that revealed increases in activity towards the larger substrate when the enzyme is partially denatured, and presumably more flexible, in addition to data revealing conformational changes under denaturing conditions.

1214,2005,Mitotic Manager: The Cytoplasmic Roles of the Yeast Cyclin Clb2,Victoria Lyo,Jennifer Hood-DeGrenier,"The cell cycle is the highly regulated sequence of events that allows for proper DNA replication and correct timing of cell division. Clb2 is the primary yeast mitotic cyclin that controls entry into mitosis by binding and activating the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. It resides predominantly in the nucleus with subpopulations at the mitotic spindle, spindle pole bodies, and the bud neck. Clb2 sub-cellular localization likely contributes to regulation of Clb2/Cdc28 activity and substrate specificity. I conducted a genetic screen and biochemical assays to elucidate the cytoplasmic roles and genetic interactions of Clb2. Knowing with which proteins cytoplasmic Clb2 interacts, we can extrapolate novel roles for Clb2 and the functional significance of its nuclear export. By delineating the regulatory mechanisms involved in cell division, this research can aid in the understanding and treatment of tumorigenesis and cancer, which stem from dysfunctions in the cell cycle.

Data from binding and activation assays of GLP-1 point mutants suggest that GLP-1 and Ex-4 have distinct and discrete receptor activating regions and receptor binding regions. We are examining the separability of these functions by truncating Ex-4 at the N-terminus and using a nonpeptide attachment to connect model small agonists to the binding region.

Previous amino acid substitutions of this histidine with lysine and with alanine have been interpreted to indicate the requirement for a positively charged residue in the N-terminal position. To further develop the structure-activity relationship for the interaction of the N-terminal amino acid of GLP-1 with GLP-1R, histidine analogs such as 1-imidazolyl-alanine (1), have been synthesized via Michael addition to an acrylic acid ester.

However, GLP-1 is short lived in vivo, thus it is necessary to find binding, nonpeptide small molecule activators of GLP-1R. Although the non peptide antagonist T-0632 (1) inhibits the release of insulin, the selective binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R makes T-0632 a potential lead compound for diabetes treatment.

What is the logic of the religious utterance? In what way can the philosopher lay bare the grammar of religion? I examine the application of this language game theory to religious language and to the grammar of religious discourse by investigating the relationships between 1) the activity or practice which confers meaning within a particular language game, 2) the language through which the practice is expressed, and 3) the rules that govern the practice and its expression.

1229,2005,"–Jessica Just Got Her Period, Letês Not Be Her Friend”: The Relation between Social Aggression and Menarche",Jazmin Reyes,Elissa Koff,"This study examined the relation between social aggression and menarche, the first period. Social aggression is a set of behaviors that harm others through damage to their self-esteem, friendships, or social status (Underwood, 2003). While both males and females have been found to engage in social aggression, research evidence suggests that females tend to be more socially aggressive, whereas males tend to be more physically aggressive. Moreover, the use of social aggression seems to increase as girls enter early adolescence. One possible explanation for the increase in social aggression among girls may be the onset of menarche, which can be a stressful and psychologically disruptive time for girls. No research to date has explored the relation between social aggression and menarche. In this study, the relation between social aggression and menarche was examined using a sample of sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-grade girls.",2005,Psychology,Psychology
1230,2005,The Realities of Make-Believe: Childrenês Relationships with Imaginary Companions,Rachel E. White ,Tracy R. Gleason,"Within relationships, individuals seek out specific characteristics, supports, or types of interaction, known as social provisions. By the time children reach preschool age they have formed relationships with family members and peers, and many have created fantasy relationships with imaginary companions (ICs). Whereas social provisions are inherent in real relationships, children must determine the provisions relationships with ICs will afford. This study investigates the provisions of companionship, conflict, instrumental aid, power, nurturance, and reliable alliance in the relationship between a child and his/her IC. Provisions are expected to differ based on the childs gender as well as the type of IC created. Data were collected through a diary kept by parents detailing episodes in which the IC appears, as well as through parent and child interviews.

The economic transition placed particular groups of women in a lower income group than men and had the ancillary effect of weakening their political representation. Womens movements are only starting to develop in Russia. To gain a deeper understanding of the situation, the Russian case must be put in international comparative perspective. In addition to Russia, I examine how women have reacted to poverty and social exclusion in Brazil where womens organizations have successfully utilized the mechanisms offered by civil society and democracy to promote their beliefs and highlight issues. In comparing Russia and Brazil, I aim to evaluate what impact the voice of women has had on the lives of the poorest women, those with little access to income, power, and democratic representation.

Cameron,"Previous studies have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in vertebrate cardiac muscle are activated during periods of decreased oxygen availability through a nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic-GMP (cGMP) mediated pathway. The purpose of my study was to determine whether activation of this ion channel in the heart plays a protective role in a species highly tolerant of low oxygen environments, the goldfish (Carassius auratus). A cellular model of environmental hypoxia was used to examine the effects of altered channel activity on isolated myocytes. Channel activation, via the presumed agonists diazoxide, SNAP, and 8-Br-cGMP, increased the survival rate of the cells under hypoxic conditions. In addition, patch-clamp experiments are currently being used to study the effects of these drugs on single channels in an effort to distinguish the cardioprotective effects of activating KATP channels at two different locations in the cell: the sarcolemma and the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Goldman,"Persistent neural activity, a sustained level of neuronal response following the presentation of a transient stimulus, is thought to be the neural correlate of short-term memory. Most previous models assume that single cells are incapable of intrinsically maintaining persistence and require implausibly fine-tuned positive feedback provided by a neural network. We propose that the fine tuning is not necessary if a cell contains a bistable mechanism distributed across multiple individual dendritic compartments. I am using the program NEURON to construct a model cell capable of generating action potentials and receiving input through individual dendritic compartments. These compartments contain bistable properties mediated by ionic channels shown to underlie dendritic plateau potentials. Once these bistable properties have been established in individual dendrites, I will test whether coupling dendrites will allow the neuron to exhibit multiple levels of persistent neural activity.

I present the results of a study that examines both the impact of capital controls over time as well as their distributional impact. The hypothesis is that a financial crisis exposes cronyism, which can then be eliminated by increased liberalization. On the other hand, the use of capital controls provides cover for continued cronyism and allows companies to delay much-needed restructuring.

Tak Matsusaka,"In todays modernizing world, Korea maintains one of the strongest economies in Asia and boasts a successful integration into the mainstream global culture of democracy and capitalism, despite the hardships of the past. The concept of han, however, remains a familiar one to the Korean public, and its importance permeates throughout society, often leading to the perception that it is a cultural characteristic unique to the Korean people. Expressed as a fusion of two polar opposite emotive concepts, sadness and hope, it remains an elusive concept difficult to define, leaving room for open interpretation and a continuous reinvention of its meanings throughout time and across a variety of situations. Introducing han with a West Wing episode, questions addressed by the talk will include, What is han? Is it a distinctly Korean term?, and How and what does it mean to the Korean people? and What keeps it alive today?",2005,East Asian Studies ,History
1263,2005,Writing before and after the Mast: Authority and Authenticity in Journal-Based Sea Narratives,Erin Aileen Flannery,Paul Fisher,"The authority to write an authentic maritime narrative is best gained by using ones own sea journal to recreate the experience. Even so, a seafaring writers background places constraints on the ultimate authenticity of the narrative. In creating a literary work from a sea journal, and thus transitioning from a private to public genre, authors infuse social commentary with their personal reflections. The journal-based sea narratives of Richard Henry Dana, Jr., Herman Melville, and John Steinbeck reflect each authors efforts to authentically recreate the social and natural dimensions of life at sea. My research, inspired by my own journal kept at sea, evaluates the authority and authenticity of Danas Two Years Before the Mast, Melvilles Redburn and Moby-Dick, and Steinbecks Log from the Sea of Cortez and Cannery Row.

Behind these themes lies a rich American Romantic tradition, of which the leading figure is Ralph Waldo Emerson. In his early essays, Emerson stresses the importance of the isolating romantic quest in order to transcend the limitations of Nature, self, and society, radically invoking the divinity of man. Melville strikes a very different chord from Emerson in Moby-Dick, depicting the fall of a tragic hero who stubbornly believes in transgressing the boundaries of self and society. By doing so, Melville emphasizes the dangers of Emersons faith in the divinity of man, for destruction and death are the only fruits of Captain Ahabs hubris.

Men and women from as far afield as France and Spain braved harsh conditions and arduous travel in an alien land in their fervent desire to see the place where these things were taught and done. These early pilgrims left for posterity wonderful texts and fabulous monuments, recording the experience of their quest for the sacred and the holy. But what of the mundane? Of the practical aspects of their journey these holy travelers made little mention, the inns and hostels in which they stayed were consumed by the sands of time. Modern scholarship, too, has tended to overlook the mundane aspects of the pilgrims progress. However, through a combination of rereading the original written sources, and examining archaeological data in a new light, the ancient pilgrimage routes and the complex system of hospitality that existed along them begin to re-emerge.",2005,Religion,Art

Central to their discourse is the question of Hawaiian identity. My thesis examines the varied understandings of land and peoplehood that play into this notion of identity and consequently shape the move for Hawaiian sovereignty. I juxtapose the legal maneuverings of the political organization Ka Lahui Hawaii with the agricultural restoration of independent taro farmers. Both factions mobilize history to invoke very specific understandings of traditional identity relationships. While Ka Lahui centers its bid for sovereignty around a revisionist reading of political events and their role in the transformation of society, agriculturists worry less about contestation within an academic frame-work; instead their calls for sovereignty are based on metaphors of cultivation and fertility passed down from generation to generation.",2005,History,"Anthropology, History"

Although this once powerful and influential population had been introduced decades earlier to Christian principles by visiting missionaries and colonists, it was not until a series of religious revivals that gripped the American colonies during the middle of the eighteenth century that the Narragansetts chose Christian conversion. The Great Awakening, as the revivals came to be known, challenged traditional forms of Protestant worship and church hierarchy, encouraging some members to create an alternate vision of their religious traditions within separate congregations. Like many of their English neighbors, the Narragansetts were also affected by the Awakenings evangelical message of personal empowerment. In response, the Narragansetts were prompted to creatively interpret New Light worship within their own religious framework, shaping a Christian identity that derived sacred power from a new source: The Englishmans God.

The explanation for the ageing of the gels rests on the formation of hydro-gen-bonds between the silanol groups present on the silica particles and the silicone oil. Our goal was to measure the electrical properties of these systems, more specifically the conductivity and dielectric constant. As the samples age, we recorded the electric characteristics and used them to explain the behavior of the suspensions.

They appear to be highly adaptable because they exist in environments with high temperatures or high salt concentrations. However they are not found in many acidic conditions because they grow best at alkaline pH. This study focuses on whether cyanobacteria can build up an acid tolerance response in order to survive in an acidic environment. The organisms were pre-exposed to mildly acidic media buffered at pH 6.3 and provided with 5% carbon dioxide and air. After the initial adaptation period, the cells were then transferred into media buffered at pH 5.5. The results showed that cyanobacteria were able to grow at the mildly acidic environment, but did not exhibit an acid tolerance response when placed into a lower pH because there was no growth. The trials were performed using different cell densities, but the pattern of growth was the same for each density.

Cyanophycin and phycocyanobilin are nitrogen storage molecules within cyanobacteria. Both storage molecules are depleted during nitrogen starvation. When cells are starved for, and then re-fed nitrogen, cyanophycin reappears within minutes, while phycocyanobilin re-synthesis takes 1-2 days. We, therefore, hypothesize that nitrogen cycles through cyanophycin into phycocyanobilin. Because the protons interact with 14N and 15N differently in the presence of a strong magnetic field due to their different nuclear spins, 1H-NMR spectroscopy can be used to decipher whether nitrogen from the medium (15N) or from breakdown of intracellular proteins (14N) is incorporated into cyanophycin and phycocyanin. It was found that the ratio of 14N to 15N decreased in cyanophycin over time. All new phycocyanobilins were completely made up of 15N.

Some studies have shown that one of the acid stress coping mechanisms of microorganisms is to maintain a neutral or slightly alkaline internal pH, also known as pH homeostasis. Moreover, studies on E. coli have suggested that the use of a sodium/proton antiporter, a protein embedded in the cell membrane that carries one substance in one direction (into the cell) and a second substance in the opposite direction (out of the cell), is involved in maintaining pH homeostasis under alkaline conditions. Do cyanobacteria share a similar coping mechanism under stress?

Cyanobacteria also contain a second nitrogen storage molecule known as phycocyanin. Studying the relationship between these two types of nitrogen storage molecules under conditions of nutrient stress illustrates the adaptation of cyanobacteria to a range of environmental conditions in which the levels of nitrogen available to them vary widely. Using cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6308, we compared the uptake of two different nitrogen isotopes in cyanophycin during nitrogen starvation and after refeeding.

1293,2005,Volumetric Alterations in the Striatum of MeCP2-Null Mice,Kathryn Swann,Joanne Berger-Sweeney,"Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that causes a range of debilitating symptoms in females and still-birth or early death in males. Over 75% of RTT cases are due to mutations in the X chromosome-linked gene that encodes the transcription repressor protein, methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Compared to healthy brains, RTT brains appear to have a 30% volume reduction, however, this decrease is not uniform throughout the brain. One region showing a marked volume reduction is the striatum, a structure involved in motor control. This study quanti_es volumes of MeCP2-null mice compared to their wild-type littermates. AMIRA software will be used to trace manually the striatum and calculate striatal volumes. Changes in striatum volume may help to explain the degeneration of purposeful movement observed in the MeCP2-null mice and in RTT patients.

1294,2005,Effects of Choline Supplementation on the Behavioral Phenotype of MeCP2 Mutant Mice,Rebecca Yang,Joanne Berger-Sweeney,"Mutations in the X-linked gene encoding MeCP2 are responsible for over 75% of all cases of Rett Syndrome (RTT): a neurodevelopmental disorder debilitating 1 in 10,000-22,000 females. RTT individuals display moderate to severe mental retardation and neuropathological evidence indicates abnormal development of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system. In normal individuals, choline supplementation during development alters the cholinergic system and facilitates improvements in adult memory. We hypothesize that choline supplementation of MeCP2 mutant mice, an animal model of RTT, will improve cognitive deficits. MeCP2 mutant and wildtype mice were supplemented with either 25 mM choline / 50 mM saccharin (test) or 50 mM saccharin alone (control) from embryonic day (ED) 10 to weaning (3 weeks). At approximately 4 weeks, reflexes, locomotion, and associative learning were assessed. These results may provide a potential pharmaceutical intervention to reverse the cognitive impairments observed in RTT.

Cameron,"Previous studies have shown that ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in vertebrate cardiac muscle are activated during periods of decreased oxygen availability through a nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic-GMP (cGMP) mediated pathway. The purpose of my study was to determine whether activation of this ion channel in the heart plays a protective role in a species highly tolerant of low oxygen environments, the gold_sh (Carassius auratus). A cellular model of environmental hypoxia was used to examine the effects of altered channel activity on isolated myocytes. Channel activation, via the presumed agonists diazoxide, SNAP, and 8-Br-cGMP, increased the survival rate of the cells under hypoxic conditions. In addition, patch-clamp experiments are currently being used to study the effects of these drugs on single channels in an effort to distinguish the cardioprotective effects of activating KATP channels at two different locations in the cell: the sarcolemma and the mitochondrial inner membrane.(Research supported by the Committee on Faculty Awards.)",2005,Neuroscience,Biological Sciences

However, despite its reputation as a gardeners worst nightmare, the plant remains an intriguing oddity, due to its unusual ability to completely shed water (much like the most expensive of raincoats). While previous studies have determined that the hydrophobicity of many plants is a physical property of surface roughness, as well as microscopic waxy crystals on the surface of the leaves, there is evidence that suggests that the chemical constituents of a plant may affect the physical integrity of its surface. This presentation will discuss how one determines the chemical constituents in a plant, as well as the different characteristics that make something waterproof.

Penguins and many species that breed in large colonies use sound as a means of recognizing individuals and conspeci_cs. Are different call characteristics used in discrimination at the individual, subspecies, or species level? Over a period of three months I recorded contact and bray calls of 65 individuals from three species of penguins at the New England Aquarium. Calls were displayed as sonograms and a variety of sound variables were measured. Using discriminant analysis, I showed that main frequency and the average length of the syllable were most important in distinguishing among species, but that syllable amplitude and frequency patterns appear to be necessary to discriminate among individuals. The ability of species level cues to discriminate between subspecies of Rockhoppers supports their separation at the species level.

The enemy is regarded as a dehumanized Other against whom one is not expected to show restraint. Similar us vs. them tensions have taken different forms in America, and African American writers have turned to both historical and literary tragedies of the past to reflect upon todays realities.

One of the most striking things about this section is its possible compatibility with a Christian idea of God. This did not escape the attention of the Christian thinker St. Thomas Aquinas, who took an interest in Aristotle and wrote a number of commentaries on his works, including one on the Metaphysics. In reading this commentary it is evident that Aquinas cautious inter-pretation of Aristotles text resulted in his belief that Aristotles account was compatible with aspects of Christianity.

Some novels show us how womens behavior was supposed to be governed by the ideal of modesty.

The Bluestocking society, for example, included numerous women intellectuals, and well-known writers such as Frances Burney. Even the Gothic novel, which was widely regarded to be a feminine genre, shows a complex nature. On the one hand, it reflects the rationalism and scientific curiosity of the period.

GLP-1 induces the production and release of insulin when bound to the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R). The non-peptide antagonist of the GLP-1R, T-0632 (1), inhibits the activation of GLP-1R by GLP-1. The binding of T-0632 to GLP-1R includes amino acid residues involved in the activation of the receptor. Utilizing the selectivity of T-0632 binding to the GLP-1R and known parameters for receptor activation, structural modifications can be made to T-0632 to form agonists of GLP-1R, thus creating a series of potential lead drug compounds for diabetes treatment. T-0632 can be efficiently synthesized in nine steps. This synthesis and the preparation of the active variations of T-0632 will be discussed. Binding profiles and c-AMP induction activities of the T-0632 analogs will be presented. (Research supported by the Roberta and Karl Staley Fund.)",2006,Chemistry,Chemistry

Currently, drug design is focusing on targeting GLP-1R to induce an insulin response in the patient to avoid direct insulin injection. The Nterminal histidine of GLP-1 is known to be important in the binding of GLP-1 to GLP-1R and essential to the ability of GLP-1 to activate GLP-1R. The twenty natural amino acids are insufficient in variety for detailed structure activity studies of histidine binding sites. A series of histidine analogs (including (1) and (2)) have been synthesized with pKas and ring nitrogen placements that differ systematically from those of histidine. It is evident from early results that the binding potential/biological activity of N-terminally modified GLP-1s varies greatly with the heteroatom position and pKa.

It is characterized by normal development from birth to six months, when motor and cognitive skills plateau and eventually decline. RTT is due to mutations in the X-linked gene that encodes a transcriptional repressor protein. Brain volumes in RTT are 30% smaller than normal. These data and behavioral research led us to hypothesize that in RTT there are selective decreases in brain regions involved in cognitive and motor skills. We tested this hypothesis in brains of a mouse model of RTT. Indeed, we found decreases in whole brain volume, as well as in regions associated with motor (the striatum), memory (the hippocampus), and anxiety (the amygdala) functions.

Accession into the European Community in 1986 represents one of the key junctures in Spains process of economic transformation that began in 1959. Of the many adjustments associated with the liberalization and restructuring of the economy following accession, some of the most significant changes occurred in the area of trade policy. Using a gravity model, I explore the effects of Spains trade liberalization program upon its bilateral and sectoral trade patterns. The results will help better our understanding of what lies in store for the ten East European countries that are joining the European Union.

This project examines the mechanics of social change by building on the principle of praxis how social theory is informed by action and, in turn, education by experience as a basis for understanding social change efforts among women in progressive philanthropy. The opportunity to step back from the activity of work in a social movement and analytically evaluate how and why women engage with progressive philanthropy and political activity allows for greater understanding of how to create change. I examine the Boston Womens Fund and related Boston-area feminist activities to explore how social class, race, gender, and identity shape and are shaped by womens involvement with progressive philanthropy and social change.

Thousands of people organized to protest Goodes hanging, gathering at rallies, signing petitions and publishing pamphlets with unprecedented urgency. Why? Judges in this period were subject to great scrutiny; was the fame of the judge who tried Goode important? Both Harding and Goode were black; was the explosive debate surrounding race and slavery in 1840s New England an influence? The evidence presented at trial was mostly circumstantial; was the trial itself flawed?

His Piano Quintet in E-flat major, op. 44 (1842) is considered one of his supreme works and has remained popular since its premiere by his wife, Clara Wieck Schumann, in 1843. Theme transference throughout all four movements creates a vigorous and exciting work. Johannes Brahms (18331897) followed in Schumann's footsteps, yet brought Romantic music to a new level with his unique compositional style. The String Quartet, op. 51, no. 2 in A Minor (1873) demonstrates Brahmsian characteristics of slow triplets and mixed rhythms which create a complete compatibility of music and sound. Schumann and Brahms  represent some of the greatest and most original chamber music composers of the Romantic Era.","2009, 200e, 200e, 2008",Economics,Music
1425,2007,"Evidence of Hydrogen Bonding in 1,2,4Triazolium Salts",Claire Reddy ,David R. Haines,"1,2,4Triazolium salts have important applications as customizable ionic solvents. When the anion is varied, an unexpected dependence of the H5 resonance on the anion is observed in CDCl3, greater downfield shifts corresponding with increased anion basicity. It is proposed that this chemical shift results from hydrogen bonding between the anion and H5 in solution. HC correlated NMR spectra were generated for 1allyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium bromide in CDCl3 at concentrations from 0.04M to 0.6M. As concentration increases, an upfield shift in H5 (12.612.2ppm) and a downfield shift in H3 (9.110ppm) is observed. A possible explanation for this shift is that as concentrations increase, hydrogen bonding to H3 becomes significant, attenuating the acidity of H5. X-ray crystallography of 1allyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium iodide and 1benzyl4phenyl1,2,4triazolium chloride show the anion located near both H3 and H5 in hydrogen bonding positions. Further investigation includes more X-ray crystallography and computational models.(Research supported by Staley Fund for Cancer-related Research.)",2009,Chemistry,Chemistry

Vancomycin functions by blocking the approach of several key enzymes involved in bacteria cell wall biosynthesis. Inappropriate administration of vancomycin over the past twenty years has led to the development of a number of vancomycin-resistant strains of bacteria. In response, researchers have set out to prepare more potent derivatives of vancomycin capable of treating vancomycin-resistant bacterial infections. Here, we present progress towards the synthesis of an entirely new analog of vancomycin that incorporates an unnatural carbohydrate residue at a key position. The proposed derivative will be used to further an understanding of the role of the carbohydrate component in the inhibition of bacterial cell wall biosynthesis, and will serve as a foundation for the design and preparation of other glycopeptide antibiotic derivatives that can be used to reverse bacterial resistance.","2008, 2009",Chemistry,Chemistry

We have prepared a gadolinium containing contrast agent, using the 1,4,7,10tetraazacyclododecane N,N',N'',N'''-tetracetate ligand. To direct this contrast agent to the site of tryptophan hydroxylase activity, we attached tryptophan at one of the acids through an amide linkage. Molecular modeling of this new ligand with a complexed gadolinium ion indicates that the pi electrons of the aromatic ring of the tryptophan interact with the gadolinium ion, resulting in exclusion of water from contact with the complexed metal ion. Upon interaction of the gadolinium complex with tryptophan hydroxylase, it is predicted that the tryptophan ring will fold out from the gadolinium ion, allowing interaction of the water molecules with the gadolinium, and resulting in increased contrast in T1weighted MR images. The synthesis and characterization of the complex, as well as preliminary contrast studies, will be discussed.",2008,Biochemistry,Chemistry

In order to measure certain properties of these condensates, the cooled gas must be released from its potential trap and allowed to expand. Oftentimes an analytic solution for the time-evolution of the BEC wave-function after release from the trap cannot be found and a numerical solution is needed. By applying a recent numerical method for solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, the time-evolution for BEC after release from potential traps of various geometries can be found. These numerical solutions can show interference effects when two condensates overlap, allowing a unique macroscopic observation of the quantum behavior of Bose-Einstein condensates.

To prevent fouling, surfaces can be coated with self-assembling thin films. We are examining the fundamental properties of thin films made from functionalized gold nanoparticles and polymers. The moderate to long-term stability of gold nanoparticle-based thin films and the thermo-responsive behavior of N-isopropylacrylamide-based polymers are being investigated. Gold nanoparticles are biocompatible and can also be used for the delivery of treatment to cells.

Academic study of video games is still limited because of their recent development, but meaningful analysis of the medium requires techniques suitable for understanding the relationship between narrative and interactivity. Since narrative implies inevitability while interactivity gives choices to the player, the two elements appear contradictory, yet the two aspects can have a synergistic relationship within game environment, game atmosphere, and characterization of the player's avatar. Depictions of the game space during cinematics provide hints and goals for actual gameplay, while the in-game space directs the events of the narrative. The mood created with cinematics carries over to the atmosphere of the gameplay, just as gameplay atmosphere affects the mood of cinematic events. In the same way, the characters' in-game appearance and abilities create a sense of personality, which cinematics further develop.",2007,Media Arts and Sciences and Russian,Computer Science

Both have worked in sweatshops since their arrival in the United States. My goal was to discover what brought them into this field, what has caused them to remain in the field, what their experiences have been in sweatshops and if there was a difference  in treatment between the genders.

From antiquity to the present, Jewish rabbis and scholars such as the medievalists Rashi and Maimonides have wrestled with such issues as the status of the fetus and the permissibility of abortion. Based on his interpretation of Talmudic passages, Rashi adopted a model of the fetus as not nefesh, which became a basis for permitting abortions in a broad range of situations. In contrast to Rashi, Maimonides' model of the fetus as rodeph provides much stricter criteria for permitting abortions. These two models have formed the basis for much of the abortion discussion in Jewish sources rooted in the Jewish textual tradition.

Kelley , Leslie Kim , Kathryn Lipford , Allison Perez , Margaret Thompson ",David R. Haines,"We are investigating the deficiencies in the insulin-induction pathway in type II diabetes mellitus. In a normal insulin-producing pathway, food enters the intestine and stimulates the production of small molecule GLP1. GLP1 then travels to the pancreas where it stimulates its receptor and results in the production of insulin. Insulin allows cells of the body to uptake glucose, whose metabolism provides the cells with the energy required to run the body.

1460,2007,Tracing Lead from the Source to the Human System,Heather Clark ,Daniel Brabander,"Lead poisoning is the most common environmental disease that affects children in the United States, and it is entirely preventable. Environmental diseases disproportionately affect urban, poor, and minority communities, and this study seeks to address the lead contamination in Roxbury and Dorchester, MA. This study evaluated the complete urban lifecycle of lead with the goal of reducing exposure to residents who use their contaminated backyard gardens to grow produce necessary for their food security. One hundred and forty-one backyard gardens were tested and 81% had lead levels above the EPA action limit. It was determined that lead originated from lead-based paint and leaded gasoline emissions. This study quantified the input of lead to the human system from four major pathways of exposure (see figure). Remediation options were also tested and are currently being implemented on a large scale with the goal of preserving environmental and public health.

1461,2007,Characterization of Toxic Metal Transport Processes Downstream of the Tar Creek Superfund Site,Mei Ai Khoo ,Daniel Brabander,"The mine waste (chat) piles at the Tar Creek Superfund Site in northeast Oklahoma have elevated concentrations of Pb, Zn, and Cd and are a major source of metal contamination to the area. Runoff from these piles, acid mine drainage from underground mines, and leaching from chat within the streambed contribute to metal loading into Tar Creek, a principal drainage system of the Superfund Site, and this ultimately into the Neosho River, a serious concern for the public and ecosystem health of the area. This research aims to identify the processes that control the transport of these metals within Tar Creek and downstream Neosho River, the extent of that transport, and the level of contamination. Using x-ray fluorescence and x-ray diffraction techniques on river sediments, it attempts to read the geochemical fingerprint of the area's recent history.

Last fall at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, I monitored a PRB with carbon substrate for denitrification and other carbon oxidation processes to determine the  effectiveness of PRBs as long-term agents for groundwater remediation. I investigated methane and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations under various tides, in the groundwater across the barrier to quantify rates of carbon oxidation, other than denitrification, occurring in the PRB, and to assess tidal influences on the barrier's function. Rates of methanogenesis ranged from 0.30Âµmol L1d1 to 0.50Âµmol L1d1, denitrification 2.50Âµmol L to 240Âµmol L1d1, and carbon oxidation 96Âµmol L1d1 to 240Âµmol L1d1.

Located downstream of Henry Wood's Sons Co. paint factory, the lake acted as an effluent depository for chromium and lead both during years of production, 1848â€“1910, and after abandonment. This study investigated the industrial history of Lake Waban through elemental and isotopic analyses of freeze cores from the deepest portion of the lake. Sediment sampling at the inlet and outlet examined present-day mobility and transport of lead. Chemical analyses of sediments were conducted using X-ray fluorescence. Sediments were dated using gamma spectroscopy with 210Pb and 137Cs radionuclide tracers and Pb sources were â€œfingerprintedâ€ using 207Pb/206Pb and 206Pb/208Pb isotopic ratios.

The Margaret Ferguson Greenhouse at Wellesley College uses both organic and chemical methods to control pests and promote overall plant health. The goal of my experiment was to determine which process was best for one species (Calendula officianalis) that, like many plants grown quickly for greenhouse display, is a magnet for pests. Calendulas were grown using different soil treatments consisting of compost, worm castings, and synthetic vs. organic fertilizer. Bloom counts measured which plants were best aesthetically and insects were monitored to determine which treatment was most pest resistant. A Chlorophyll A-Fluorometer ascertained plant stress and the shoot biomass demonstrated which treatment harbored the best growth. Recognizing the best soil conditions for this plant will help determine the extent to which future horticultural displays can be produced organically.

U.S. laws and their related policies and practices regarding termination of parental rights uniquely and unjustly impact incarcerated mothers causing them to be at high risk for losing their parental rights. Ideals and concepts about motherhood, criminality, race and class drive these laws and practices.

Narcissistic individuals include people whose lives focus on issues of self-definition, self-worth, identity, and autonomy. In its broadest interpretation, narcissism can be characterized as self-investment. In its most adaptive form, this self-investment serves to enhance psychological wellbeing and promote positive feelings about oneself. In its maladaptive form, narcissistic individuals are most often characterized by negative behaviors such as exaggerated self-entitlement, exploitation, and grandiosity. One hundred and ninety Wellesley students completed multiple measures of narcissism and body image. Results are expected to demonstrate a positive correlation between body image and overt narcissism and a negative correlation between body image and covert narcissism.

1477,2007,The Impact of Welfare Reform on Immigrant Health,Audrey Stern ,Courtney Coile,"The 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act involved substantial changes in immigrant eligibility for public assistance. Before the reform, immigrants had access to welfare programs on the same basis as citizens. Following the reform, immigrant access varied depending on their state of residence, as the reform let states decide whether to continue to offer immigrants access to welfare programs, and year of arrival, as only those immigrants who arrived after the reform's enactment were affected. As a result, immigrant eligibility for public benefits has been reduced to a greater extent than citizen eligibility and immigrants face far wider variation across states in their access to safety-net services. I explore these state-level differences in program eligibility to estimate the effect of welfare reform on the health of immigrant children using the Vital Statistics Linked Birth Infant Death Data Set.

During the last 12 years, home prices have more than tripled. They are now falling. A continuing downturn in the housing market could have serious consequences for households and for the underlying economy. Strong evidence suggests that consumer spending by households responds to changes in wealth, including housing wealth. Furthermore, any drop in construction can have a direct effect on GDP growth. Finally, a sharp decline in prices would be likely to cause a rise in mortgage loan defaults and foreclosures and could cause serious problems for financial markets. This thesis is designed to shed light on two important aspects of price determination in the recent downturn: demographics and psychology. To do so, I sent out 1,000 surveys to a randomly selected sample of buyers and sellers in the Boston housing market during the time of the recent slowdown.

Allen,"Cyanobacteria, this planet's oldest known organisms, are photosynthetic bacteria important in maintaining oxygen in the earth's atmosphere. They are alkaliphilic and have been shown to increase the pH of their environment via several postulated means, including amino acid decarboxylation, when placed in acidic media. Amino acid decarboxylases are enzymes that catalyze the reaction in which a carboxyl group is removed from amino acids as carbon dioxide. Secretion of the resulting highly basic amine will raise the pH of the environment. We are using a carbon dioxide assay for decarboxylase activity and Western Blot analysis for decarboxylase synthesis in order to determine whether increased activity and/or increased synthesis of amino acid decarboxylases are part of the acid stress response of cyanobacteria. Current data have shown both increased decarboxylase activity and increased decarboxylase synthesis in acid stressed bacteria, suggesting that amino acid decarboxylation is involved in the acid stress response of cyanobacteria.

1499,2007,Interactions of Wild Type Buforin II with Physiologically Relevant Lipid Membranes,Natalya Maharaj ,Donald Elmore,"Antimicrobial peptides are short proteins that are produced by a wide variety of  organisms to kill bacteria and other microbial cells. Buforin II, a 21amino acid peptide isolated from the stomach of the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, is one such peptide, which enters its target cells and destroys them through subsequent binding to DNA. Our research focuses on how buforin II interacts with these lipid membranes. We examined the interaction of buforin II with lipid membranes of varying chemical characteristics and concentrations. Previous work in the Elmore lab has considered interactions with membranes consisting of only phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol. However, our studies include two additional lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, which allows us to study how buforin II interacts with more physiologically relevant membranes. By analyzing these interactions, we hope to further elucidate the mechanism by which buforin interacts with and enters cells.

One such peptide, buforin II, a more potent form of the buforin I peptide isolated from the Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans, enters the cell via formation of pores in the cell membrane. In order to better understand the membrane translocation mechanism of buforin II on a molecular level, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations of buforin II-lipid membrane interactions using GROMACS. By applying a transmembrane potential, we have biased the entry of buforin into the membrane on the simulation timescale. In an age where bacterial resistance to drugs and antibiotics increases rampantly, studying antimicrobial peptides is important as they demonstrate promise as novel therapeutic agents, possessing a broad range of activity against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, viruses, and even cancerous cells.(Research supported by the Office of the Dean of the College.)",2007,Biochemistry,Chemistry
1501,2007,Progestin Receptor Expression in Rat Brain and Uterus,Stephanie-Lydia Njemanze ,Marc J. Tetel,"The steroid hormone, progesterone, acts in the brain to influence a variety of events, including female reproduction in rodents. Progesterone elicits many of its biological effects by binding to intracellular progestin receptors (PR) in specific brain regions. PR is expressed as two molecular forms from the same gene, full length PRB and the truncated PRA. My research involves developing Western blots for PR in the rat brain and uterus, a technique to determine PR protein expression. Recently, our lab has explored protein-protein interactions to determine other proteins, or coactivators, that are necessary for hormone-dependent gene expression. My project will extend this work to PR action in the brain. We hope to identify new coactivators that  participate in hormone action in the brain and uterus. Further knowledge of hormone action may increase our understanding of mechanisms connected to hormone dependent diseases, such as uterine and breast cancer.

1502,2007,Role of Potassium Ion Channels in the Survival of Goldfish without Oxygen,Sarah D. Park ,John S. Cameron,"Compared to other vertebrates, goldfish (Carassius auratus) are unique in their capacity to endure for up to five days with no environmental oxygen. Previous data from our laboratory suggest that the activation of specific ion channels is one factor that helps to protect vulnerable tissues under low oxygen (hypoxic) conditions. Hypoxia-induced activation of ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels in the heart, for example, may serve to increase tolerance of low oxygen. The purpose of this study was to resolve the mechanism by which this channel is activated when oxygen levels are low, and, specifically, to assess the role of nitric oxide (NO)-sensitive guanylyl cyclase (GC) and protein kinase G (PKG) in channel opening. Our data suggest that increased activity of GC is involved in the opening of KATP channels, but that this response is independent of PKG.

After the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, the German people lost all sense of pride in their nation. Far more than a national pastime, German soccer gave the country a renewed sense of patriotism beginning with the World Cup victory in 1954. When Germany successfully hosted the World Cup in 1974, it proved to the international visitors that it had become a welcoming and democratic country. After German reunification, a united national team of East and West Germans went on to win the World Cup in 1990. In 2006, Germany again played host to the World Cup and, for the first time since 1945, German flags decorated everything from shop windows to cars to strollers. This type of healthy patriotism, standard in most countries, is a revolutionary change in postwar Germany. ",2007, International Relations,History

However, later generations felt that the GDR and its institutions (especially the â€œStasiâ€) took their political freedom away as the system required sacrifice of ideology and lifestyle. Hence, members of the younger generations wanted the system to be replaced. However, the reunification of Germany did not succeed in integrating the younger generations of East Germans into the newly established society. The attempt of German institutions to identify ex-Stasis and prosecute them when possible disrupted the process of creating a common culture already disturbed by fifty years of separation.  Since the older generations did not solve the problem, the young ones are left unassisted in this transition.",2009,German Language and Literature,German
1507,2007,Decision-making Determinants in 2x2 Global Games: Some Experimental Results,Chenying Zhang ,Susan Skeath,"Many important economic phenomena are modeled as coordination games. For example, bank runs and currency crises can be modeled as coordination games with incomplete information about payoffs; this type of game is referred to as a â€œglobalâ€ game. Most of the existing work on global games is theoretical and few experimental results have been reported. I designed an experiment to test whether players perform as the theory predicts in a 2x2 global game and to determine whether behavior converges to the complete information equilibrium. The experiment results show that the mere existence of uncertainty regarding payoffs has an enormous impact on player behavior and that player behavior does not conform to the theoretical prediction. I propose several explanations for the observed behavior. Because the 2x2 game serves as the most basic model of the generalized multiperson global game, the experimental results have important implications for building financial models.

The practice of stock option backdating, in which management manipulates the timing of option grants to the date of a particularly low stock price, has emerged as a topic of particular concern in the past year. Stock option backdating is an issue of corporate governance: it is the absence of sufficient shareholder protections that ultimately allows managers to have a greater amount of influence over the terms of their compensation, including the timing of stock option grants. In my thesis, I examine the extent to which strong shareholder protections mitigate backdating and suggest that companies with strong governance provisions have a lower incidence of backdating due to more stringent controls on management behavior, giving them less freedom to engage in opportunistic behavior.",2007,Economics,Economics

This collaborative independent study under Professor Case and a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston economist explores to what extent financial innovations can help explain the U.S. economy's greater stability using a difference-in-difference method. We compare the change in volatility across different types of investment â€“ business fixed, residential and consumer durables â€“ with the change in financing frictions for each type. If financial innovations mitigate credit constraints and enable households and firms to better smooth consumption and production respectively, then an investment whose financing arrangements have seen more innovations should  experience a larger decline in growth  volatility.

This study is testing the relationship between locomotory rhythms and levels of Pigment Dispersing Hormone (PDH) in neurons and synaptic areas of the crayfish Procambaraus clarkii and Cherax destructor. In previous studies, P. clarkii shows a locomotory rhythm in constant dark conditions (D/D) reminiscent of that present in 12hr light/12hr dark (L/D), suggesting that locomotion is driven by an endogenous circadian clock. In contrast, C. destructor is arrhythmic in D/D despite having a locomotory rhythm entrained to a 24hr clock while in L/D conditions. In this species, in L/D conditions, PDH levels cycle over a 24hour period in specific neurons and synaptic brain regions. These data suggest that PDH may be an output of the endogenous clock.

This conspicuous consumption is of concern in light of the crucial role that the moving image can play in shaping identities, providing social commentary, and creating jobs and other avenues of economic growth. This study analyzes the historical, social, economic, and political forces and structures that have reinforced the â€œcolonizationâ€ of the screen in Senegal, a nation that once showed enormous promise in film production in the decade following independence. To what extent have French support, currency devaluation, and IMF Structural Adjustment Programs been used as indirect tools of industry intervention? Emphasized in this study as harbinger to change in the future is the emerging digital trend being adopted by younger filmmakers and the new possibilities created by its decentralization of knowledge and opportunity.

His intellectual battles with the anarchists are especially demonstrative of the fundamentally conflictual â€“ and even combative nature â€“ of intellectual disputes. This spring semester I have studied three central figures in nineteenth-century anarchism and their intellectual responses and exchanges with Karl Marx: Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, and Peter Kropotkin. Throughout the study of these three different intellectual disputes, I have explored examples of varied intensities of intellectual exchange. In this presentation, I will focus on one specific case study of the vitriolic political and intellectual battles between Karl Marx and Mikhail Bakunin, battles which Marx essentially won, with great historical consequences. My presentation is a sociological analysis of the various aspects and dimensions of intellectual conflict.",2008,Sociology and German Language and Literature,Sociology

What is not generally known is that during the Spanish Inquisition, the numerical majority of trials were not of Jews, Moors, Protestants, or even a combination â€“ they were of Spanish Catholics. This interesting topic has not been extensively covered in existing historical writings and has not attracted the attention that it merits. The Inquisition existed originally to rout out Jews and Moors from Spain, but quickly spread to impact all of Spanish society. This presentation will focus on the prosecution of Old Christians in the Spanish Inquisition, and show the evolution of standards originally designed for Moors and Jews becoming the means to prosecute and persecute anyone who contested those in power.",2008,History and Peace and Justice Studies,History
1538,2007,Moral Crimes and International Law: Evolution of the Concept of Genocide in the Context of the ICTY,Robin Miller ,Thomas Cushman,"For lawyers, there is no hierarchy of international crimes; war crimes and genocide are on the same level. For human rights scholars however, genocide is â€œthe crime of crimesâ€; it is particularly reprehensible because it entails not only the destruction of a people, but the intent to destroy because of victims' membership in a certain group. I explore the changing conception of genocide within the context of the International Criminal Tribunal of the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), focusing on how â€œgenocideâ€ is differentially defined and utilized by human rights scholars and lawyers. Analysis of ICTY genocide cases, scholarly writings on human rights, and interviews with ICTY prosecutors will reveal the current status of â€œgenocideâ€ as a moral and legal category. Additionally, my thesis examines the moral compromises inherent in prosecution of gross human rights violations. (Research supported by a Schiff Fellowship.)",2007,Sociology,Sociology

This presentation offers a sociological analysis of the social construction of evil. Through the use of ethnographic content analysis of Xinhua, China's largest circulating newspaper, I examine how the Chinese government justifies its criminalization of the Falun Gong (a new religion banned in China since July 1999).

1540,2007,The Nature of Imaginary Companions: Answers from Children and Parents,Madeline Harms ,Tracy Gleason,"Nearly half of the children in the United States create imaginary companions at some point during their development, either in the form of invisible friends or personified objects. The current study examines children's motives for creating imaginary companions and the types of relationships children maintain with these companions. Because children sometimes have difficulty articulating their thoughts, parents are an important source of information. However, parents view the relationship from an outside perspective and may therefore be unaware of certain details about their child's imaginary companion. For this presentation, I examined data from interviews with preschool children and parents to determine the degree to which children agree with their parents, on both simple questions, such as the imaginary companion's age and gender, and more complex inquiries into what the child likes about the companion. This analysis will help to determine the differences in parents' perceptions in this field of research.",2008,Psychology,Psychology

Are particular personality traits related to a high frequency of Internet-mediated communication with one's significant other? This study examined the relationship between Internet-mediated communication in romantic relationships and shyness, introversion, self-presentation, and related personality traits. I administered a survey to female undergraduates to assess Internet use, personality variables, and attitudes about romantic relationships. I analyzed participant data based on shyness and introversion levels. I expected that highly shy, introverted participants would use the Internet to mediate romantic relationships with more frequency than extraverted, non shy participants, with other variables qualifying this main hypothesis.

Calling on his own transformation from doubt to faith, however, resulted in anti-Christian arguments so refined and artistically flawless that they threatened to devastate the Christian premise of his works. Responding to critical reviews of Brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky wrote the following: â€œThese fools could not even conceive so strong a denial of God as the one to which I gave expression...it is not like a child that I believe in Christ and confess him. My hosanna has come through a crucible of doubt.â€ In my senior thesis, I will examine the impact of this perversion of Christian doctrine on a modern reader's interpretation of Dostoevsky's late novels.",2007,Russian and French,Russian

Among the numerous autistic-like symptoms that affect RTT patients, breathing abnormalities are among the most severe, eventually causing death by respiratory arrest in up to 26% of patients. My investigation examines the structural basis for these respiratory symptoms in a MeCP2 knockout mouse model through a histological quantification of pulmonary cell morphology and an immunofluorescence protocol designed to determine the cellular localization of MeCP2 in the mouse lung. The findings of this study will help to elucidate the pathology of breathing abnormalities in RTT patients and could contribute to the development of new therapies that target the structural basis of these symptoms.

1551,2007,The Interaction of Buforin II with Lipid Vesicles of Varying Composition,Jessica Chen ,Donald Elmore,"Buforin II is a 21amino acid cationic  antimicrobial peptide isolated from the stomach tissue of Asian toad Bufo bufo gargarizans in 1996. It is hypothesized to target bacteria nonspecifically by crossing biological membranes without membrane permeabilization and binding to DNA. My research focuses on how lipid composition affects membrane binding and translocation of buforin II. The experiments performed utilize lipid vesicles as a model for biological membranes. To this end, I have used a fluorescence titration method to measure the binding of buforin II to lipid vesicles with varying compositions of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylcholine, a negatively charged and neutral lipid. Current results suggest that the binding strength between buforin II and the lipid vesicles increases as the amount of negatively charged lipids increase. I have also adapted a biotin-avidin based protocol to measure buforin II translocation, across lipid vesicles of varying composition.

The structural importance of the three tandem LNR modules in Notch function is revealed by recent structural data from the extracellular domain of human Notch2. Based on sequence alignments and preliminary biochemical information, LNR repeats are predicted to be also present in PAPP and Stealth proteins. Selective Ca2+ binding and a unique disulfide bonding pattern are critical for the correct folding of the prototype LNR module and are thereby suggested to be the determining features of an LNR module. This work focuses on producing and purifying the first LNR module form Notch1 and Notch2 using a bacterial expression system in preparation for studies to determine the binding affinities of various divalent atoms for these modules.

1553,2007,The â€œIntra-household Flypaper Effectâ€ in a Nutrition Program in Rural Guatemala,Mahnaz Islam ,Ann Velenchik,"In developing countries, programs designed to improve child nutrition are widespread. The ability of such programs to improve the nutrition of individual children depends on how households choose to allocate resources among their members. If one child in a family is given a free meal in school, her parents might transfer some household food to other members of the family, such as her siblings. This implies that policies that target specific individuals in a household may be mostly neutralized by reallocations of the resource away from the child. On the other hand, the transfer may not be reallocated away, a phenomenon referred to as the intra-household â€˜flypaper effect' because the transfer â€˜sticks' to the child. This project seeks to explore the â€˜flypaper effect' using data from a nutrition intervention in rural Guatemala from 1969 to 1977.

However, 10% of these reefs have been destroyed while a predicted 60% are on the verge of collapse due to environmental and anthropogenic effects including overexploitation, coastal development, inland or marine-based pollution, and global climate change. This degradation results in the loss of habitat and the potential extinction of many species that inhabit the reef. The parrotfish is a keystone species that helps to maintain all reefs of the world via the grazing of algae and the breakdown of calcareous sediment. With growing reef degradation comes a heightened decline of parrotfish, thereby resulting in less reef maintenance and thus the potential for continued reef decline and loss of biodiversity.",2009,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

Our research serves to elucidate the pivotal role that these low-energy electron-induced reactions play in high-energy radiation-induced chemical reactions in condensed matter. For example, cosmic rays produce low-energy electrons that, through interactions with CF2Cl2, produce Cl atoms that may con-tribute to the formation of the ozone hole. We conjecture that low-energy electrons also play a pivotal role in biology based on a recent claim that the cyclic variation of extra-galactic cosmic ray flux may help explain cycles of biodiversity on earth. Low-energy electron-induced reaction studies such as ours also have important implications for industry, including the cost-efficient destruction of hazardous materials and the electron-induced decomposition of feed gases used in the plasma processing of semiconductor devices.","2008, 2010","Neuroscience, Chemistry",Chemistry

According to Eysenck's theory of extraversion, extraverts have an innately higher cortical arousal threshold for sensory stimuli than do introverts. However, people with high sensory-processing sensitivity, or ‰ÛÏhighly sensitive people,‰Û? are hypothesized to have a much lower cortical arousal threshold and to be easily overwhelmed by sensory stimuli than those with low sensory-processing sensitivity. How then do highly sensitive extraverts satisfy their conflicting needs for social stimulation and an escape from sensory overload? This study hypothesized that highly sensitive extraverts experience more general anxiety and are more aroused by anxiety-inducing situations than extraverts who are not highly sensitive. Discussion will focus on data collected before and after participants engaged in a potentially anxiety-arousing social interaction.",2009,Psychology,Psychology

One strategy is the implementation of mindfulness, the awareness of emotions, behavior and experiences in a non-judgmental manner. This awareness is presented through paying attention, on purpose, to the present moment. While it is possible for mindfulness to be a part of innate personality, mindfulness may also be identified as a learned skill. Wellesley College students completed tests to measure mindfulness, extraversion, neuroticism, and anxiety, in addition to participating in a mindfulness exercise (mindful meditation). Results indicated that students who scored higher on extra-version had higher mindfulness scores as well as lower initial state anxiety scores in comparison to the introvert group. Results suggest that the change in anxiety was a function of extraversion. This study illustrates that the use of mindfulness exercises to reduce anxiety appears optimistic and confirms the interest in clinical programs such as Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction.",2008,Psychology and Anthropology,Psychology

Tetel, Neuroscience","Estradiol (E) and progesterone (P) act in the brain to profoundly influence a variety of events, including cognition and reproductive behavior. These hormones carry out their physiologic effects by binding to their receptors, the estrogen receptor (ER) and the progestin receptor (PR), each of which is expressed as two distinct isoforms. Previous research has shown that coactivators, including Steroid Receptor Coactivator-2 (SRC-2), physically interact with ER and PR to facilitate transcription of target genes. In this study, pull-down assays were performed to determine if SRC-2 from rat brain interacts with the isoforms of ER and PR under various ligand conditions. Results show preferential inter-actions between SRC-2 and certain receptor isoforms, indicating that the receptor isoforms have different functions in brain. These findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of how hormones function in brain to regulate hormone-dependent gene expression and behavior.

The belief that gender functions as a criteria for representation drives this initiative. But the question remains: Do women in politics represent other women? While gender quotas might lead to an increased presence of women in politics, these quotas do not necessarily ensure a political culture wherein women can represent other women substantively. In Pakistan, the government has reserved a substantial percentage of seats for women in local, provincial, and national-level representative bodies. But the institutionalized culture of patriarchy in politics poses an obstacle to women elected through quotas to performing their role as representatives.

As a result of mortgage institutions' lax lending practices and other factors, investors appear to have underestimated the risk inherent in mortgage-backed securities (MBS). In a short period of time, risk was repriced across the board and liquidity for mortgage-backed securities dried up as they lost their appeal for investors. Like many other financial crises such as bank runs, currency crises, and debt crises, the subprime meltdown can be analyzed using a global-games framework where the con-sequences of an individual's actions depends on what others do.

Such crises have become increasingly common in emerging markets. In fact, some researchers claim that external financial shocks impose the largest costs to emerging market economies, even more than conflict and wars. Because these crises are extremely costly, preventing them should be a top priority for public-policy makers. The major issue that stalls attempts to prevent banking crises from occurring is the lack of general consensus as to what triggers them.

Today, both the Peoples War and the autocratic rule of the King have ended. Maoists are being rehabilitated; Nepal moves towards Constituent Assembly elections. But were the peasants ever revolutionary? A revolutionary peasant, according to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists), will have both the political consciousness and the organizational ability to seize state power. However, many Nepali peasants were up in arms, not to seize state power, but to secure their land rights. Further, revolutionary politics in Nepal today includes nonparty agents as well as political parties. Peasants were mobilized by the dynamic involvement of NGOs advocating for land rights on behalf of the peasants. With the help of these NGOs, Nepali peas-ants organized themselves into a nation-wide network demanding their rights and land reform. As peasants gain political consciousness they do so to claim their rights, not necessarily to overthrow the state.

Previous results showed increased decarboxylase activity in acid-stressed cyanobacteria. Western Blot analysis of decarboxylase synthesis is being used to determine whether synthesis of amino-acid decarboxylases is part of the acid-stress response of cyanobacteria.

The increase in pH appears to be density dependent when cells are stressed below a pH 6 ‰ÛÒ denser cultures demonstrate a greater increase in pH than less dense ones. Cells grown in non-acid-stress conditions also demonstrate an increase in external pH over time, but the increase is not density dependent. It is hypothesized that acid-stressed cyanobacteria excrete something into their environment, raising the pH. Ammonia was selected as a possible candidate for excretion since ammonium is readily avail-able in the cell, thanks to its role in nitrogen assimilation. Ammonium development over time in acid-stressed cultures was found, but never in a culture that survived the acid stress. It is possible that ammonium measured in these cultures came from lysed cells and not active excretion.

In this unique linguistic community, the children have rapidly added the linguistic means to encode spatial relationships, while the adults have yet to acquire such language. This creates an inverted community where adults have more experience with how objects are spatially related than children do, but have less understanding of spatial language. This study examined whether mental rotation skills of the Deaf Nicaraguan signers correlated with their mastery of spatial language. We examined older signers, younger signers, and a comparison group of 11 American Sign Language (ASL) signers. We found that younger Nicaraguan signers outperformed the older ones, and their performance correlated with their spatial language. Further, their mental rotation skills did not significantly differ from ASL signers. Thus, language seems to play an important role in spatial cognition.

We hypothesize that the negative and cognitive symptoms are related to malfunctions in the glutamatergic neurochemical system. We are working with mice with a genetic mutation in one enzyme in the glutamatergic system to model the symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Here we show that the mutant mice react virtually identically to controls in pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), a behavioral test to determine whether the mice can learn to dampen a response to high-decibel sounds. Other previous studies have used pre-pulse inhibition to model schizophrenic symptoms. These data do not support our original hypothesis but may indicate that symptoms resulting from the mutation may be too subtle to detect with PPI.

Although growth and division are distinct cellular processes, links between the TOR pathway and the cell-division cycle are likely to exist. Research shows that cells lacking Clb5, an important cell-cycle regulator called a cyclin, are hypersensitive to rapamycin, suggesting that TOR and Clb5 may have overlapping functions. Rapamycin treatment has been shown to cause microtubule depolymerization and nuclear-positioning defects in wild type cells. Using fluorescence microscopy, this research aims to determine if these defects explain the rapamycin hypersensitivity of Clb5 and, more broadly, to uncover a novel connection between TOR and the cell cycle.

Estradiol induces progesterone receptor (PR) expression in brain regions involved in female reproduction. Nuclear-receptor coactivators enhance the ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of steroid receptors, including estrogen receptors (ER) and PR. Work by our lab and others has shown that two nuclear-receptor coactivators, steroid-receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1) and SRC-2, are important in ER-mediated induction of PR in brain and in steroid-dependent behaviors. In order for nuclear-receptor coactivators to function in hormone-dependent transcription and behavior, the receptor and coactivator must be expressed in the same cell. Using a triple-label immunoflurescence technique, we will determine if individual PR containing cells in brain express SRC-1 and SRC-2. These experiments will further our understanding of basic mechanisms of how hormones act in the brain, and their possible role in brain disorders such as depression and Alzheimer's disease.

Specifically, we are investigating the 599-611 loop region of TOP which has been chosen because of its high glycine content, known to give an enzyme flexibility.

In October 1998, Hurricane Mitch made landfall, bringing with it flooding and winds that killed thousands, destroyed vast amounts of infrastructure, and left hundreds of thou-sands with limited access to food, water, and shelter. The resulting shock to nutrition in children in the early stages of development will have a long-term impact on their physical and cognitive development and also negatively affect school enrollment, and educational attainment. I will look at how early childhood malnutrition played a role in delayed school enrollment for those children impacted by Hurricane Mitch.

Aid accomplishes much good, but its particular execution often fails to take advantage of available resources. This has resulted in inefficiencies that deprecate recipients' self-image and engender new ambitions that in the grand scheme tend to undo much of the good aid has made possible: watered-down condensed milk instead of breastfeeding for infants, ill-adapted concrete rather than well-adapted bamboo houses, hospital-centered rather than preventative health care. The purpose of this presentation is to explore the reasons why aid does not seem to work at its maximum potential, to examine the negative consequences, and to offer some suggestions for improving aid's effective-ness.

By examining the context of religious revivalism both as an invented identity of colonization and as an inherent ideal for religious groups in India, I will discuss the narratives of many Punjabi Hindu Nationalists who migrated to India from what is now Pakistan. Hindu Nationalists debated with members of the Muslim League and other groups over how to make the nation truly independent, discussing issues such as representation in the new government and choosing a national language. Furthermore, Partition caused rifts not only on communal or sectarian lines, but also along regional and ideological lines. Thus my work illustrates the trajectory of partition from invented British colonial definitions of identity to the way these identities were internalized and continued after Independence.

Visions for a postcolonial nation were often divided between a religious, ethnic interpretation of national identity and the lure of a more modern, often socialist overthrow of Empire. Not mere products of cultural coincidence, intellectual elites of Ireland and India often found themselves in London. Through movements such as Labour, Theosophy, and modernist literature, the anticolonial nationalist dialectic was played out within the cultural bounds of the city. Intellectual currents interacted with Indian and Irish expatriate populations to construct a political narrative that was aware of, yet distinct from, corresponding anticolonial movements within India and Ireland themselves, and attached instead to the metropole of the Empire.",2008,History,History

As a result of these characteristics being ascribed to intellectuals, they occupy a privileged space in society. Because of their presumed disinterest, their ideas are often accepted as the most correct, as uncorrupted by the need for financial and other forms of gain. However, studies of interactions among intellectuals reveal that they cannot simply be defined as disinterested and purely rational. Instead, it is evident that factors such as nonrational emotional arguments and status anxiety play a significant role in the work of intellectuals.

He was one of the more influential intellectuals in MÌ©xico's early history.

This new era would be based on the joy and love of knowledge and not on skin color, ethnicity, or convenience. Vasconcelos' work has often been read as a racist text. I propose an alternative reading, one which understands race within the debates intellectuals like Vasconcelos took part in the early twentieth century. I argue that Raza then was understood in spiritual and cultural terms rather than biological ones. The controversies that have surrounded Vasconcelos's writings are due in great part to this misinterpretation. I propose further that in order to more fully understand Vasconcelos' theories one must look at his intellectual development historically and consider, among other things, his growing up during El Porfiriato, the impact of positivism and of the Mexican Revolution in his thinking as well as his appointment as the first Secretary of Education in 1921.

One accepted theory of facial representation describes a â€œface-spaceâ€ where faces are points in a Cartesian space; multiple dimensions represent the varying ways to distinguish faces (e.g. by gender, age). Inverted faces, being especially difficult to recognize, are proposed to not be represented in this perceptual space. This summer, I used a contrast-based adaptation paradigm to measure human subjects' abilities to discriminate images of inverted or upright faces (test) after adapting to a face in either orientation (adaptor). By varying the contrast, and thus difficulty, of test faces, I could see which adaptors facilitated or harmed test-face recognition. Surprisingly, upright adaptors affected the recognition of inverted tests, but not vice-versa. This asymmetry in adaptation transfer suggests that separate neuronal populations code each orientation, but have some one-way interaction.

For example, upon learning that a toy has a squeaking property, infants can infer that a similar looking toy also squeaks. They accurately generalize that object property even if only small amounts of data are available. But what makes their inferences so accurate? Studies have shown that infants as young as eight months can tell the difference between random and non-random samples of a population of toys, showing a powerful capacity for inductive learning. The present study explores how infants' sensitivity to statistical properties of a sample may constrain inductive inferences, thereby increasing the accuracy of their generalizations.

The archaic representations of the female dragon lady, lotus blossom, butterfly, or the forever impotent and effeminate Asian man continue to resurface in response to new forms of â€œyellow peril,â€ â€œyellow face,â€ and model minority stereotypes. Although current research and literature delve into the way in which Asian American representations are constructed in prime-time television and the media, research in regard to the latest televised phenomenonâ€”reality televisionâ€”is sparse. Reality television is a medium not only through which representation is constructed, but also one in which authenticity is negotiated. By functioning under the pretense of â€œreality,â€ these shows blur the line between truth and fiction. As a result, reality television character portrayals, including Asian American depictions, become complex, misleading, and paradoxical.

Since the early 1990s, 20 states have implemented extended dependent coverage laws, allowing unmarried young adults to be covered under a parent's private health insurance plan until their 25th birthday. This research examines whether these laws work as designed to increase health insurance rates among young adults.

Wine is produced in 48 states, often by small-scale wineries whose owners long to expand their business by selling directly to customers nationwide. Many state governments, however, prohibit the direct shipment of wine from out-of-state producers to consumers in their state. Wine must instead pass through wholesalers, who contend that allowing direct shipping would harm not only their business, but also consumers and wineries. Consumers are frustrated by an inability to purchase certain wines locally and accuse wholesalers of using their monopoly on distribution to inflate prices. I will discuss the relevant legal issues and the results of two natural experiments focused on the economic effects of shipping laws in five states, including Massachusetts, that restrict the direct shipment of wine to varying degrees.",2009,Economics and Russian Language and Literature,Economics

Two landmark pieces of legislation in the 1990s, the Riegle-Neal of 1994, and the Gram-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, resulted in significant consolidation of smaller banks into larger institutions. This may have had a particularly important impact on women-owned businesses, as women-owned businesses tend to be smaller than men-owned businesses. My research examines the impacts of these banking law changes on the relative access to credit for women-owned businesses compared to men-owned businesses. Using the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Small Business Finances, I look at loan interest rates, size of loans, and likelihood of loan approval for women-owned businesses, controlling for observable characteristics, before and after each law passed to determine the impact of financial modernization on loan financing for women-owned businesses. I further test for whether, conditional on loan terms, female-owned businesses have better outcomes than male-owned businesses. If so, that would provide evidence that banks are using a different decision rubric to determine whether to make loans to women-owned firms.",2009,Economics and Spanish,Economics

He demonstrates this idea in his song cycle, Ariettes oubliées (1885–7), which is based on poems by the Symbolist poet, Paul Verlaine (1844–1896). Debussy uses compositional innovations in harmony, melody, and texture to highlight natural imagery in his songs. These musical techniques allowed Debussy to convey an experience of nature that was in keeping with ideals of Symbolism, a nineteenth-century literary movement that favored the evocation of objects and emotions through elusive suggestion rather than explicit textual representation. In this presentation, I will undertake text-music analysis to inform my performance of song extracts.

Though historically a country of emigration, Italy has some of the toughest and most unforgiving immigration laws in the European Union. Racism and discrimination against immigrants are a recognized problem for both the citizenry and the government. Italian immigration law reflects these negative attitudes. It permits immigrants to enter Italy relatively easily, but makes it nearly impossible for these immigrants to renew their visas and maintain their legal statuses. Instead of returning home, most of these irregular migrants become illegal and are forced to work in the grey sector to preserve their livelihoods.

The historian Donald Worster argues, â€œThe protection of wild nature owes much to the spread of modern liberal, democratic ideals...â€ Based on qualitative studies of the history of environmental protection, he and other historians have argued that democracy has been a driving force in the creation of national parks, wilderness areas, and wildlife refuges. Other scholars, however, drawing primarily on individual case studies, have argued that such nature reserves are often coercive, representing the imposition of government-sanctioned conservation practices on local communities. To address this apparent contradiction, this study evaluates which national characteristics, including the strength of a state's democracy, the size of its economy, and the extent of its biodiversity, best predict its commitment to establishing nature reserves.

Virgo, Chemistry Department","Design, simulation and optimization of electrostatic lenses are crucial to the ion imaging techniques employed to investigate molecular chemical reaction dynamics. The images obtained from studies of photodissociation dynamics are particularly dependent on the electrostatic lens configuration, which determines the spatial quality of the image. In order to optimize image spatial resolution, a simple three-plate electrostatic lens with open electrodes is simulated so that all particles with the same initial velocity vector are mapped onto the same position on a 2D detector, regardless of their initial distance from the electrostatic lens axis. Characterization of the electrostatic lens apparatus is performed using a 3D ion trajectory simulation software package. The simulations are designed to accurately reproduce experimental results and guide the design of a new experimental velocity map imaging apparatus.

However, experiments have shown that the NCN bond of the molecule is, in fact, slightly bent. In an effort to understand this deviation from theory, the tools of computational chemistry were used for electronic structure calculations and molecular orbital visualizations. Besides investigating the nonlinearity of cyanamide's NCN bond with multiple levels of theory, this project also explored the properties of substituted cyanamides to see how the different substituents affect the NCN bond angle in these molecules. Results from this research will hopefully broaden our current understanding of molecular structure and bonding in such compounds.

For instance, if individuals are asked to identify a very briefly flashed word (e.g. 13 milliseconds), performance is improved if they have had recent exposure to the word. Surprisingly, while explicit memory is impaired in amnesia, implicit memory, including priming, is largely retained.

Arguments are phrases that form integral components of a verb’s meaning, while adjuncts are simply “modifiers.” For example, in “Mary gave the package to the mailman in the afternoon,” “in the afternoon” is an adjunct, while the other bracketed phrases are arguments. This distinction is important for the study of linguistic ambiguity, especially PP-attachment ambiguity. For example, the PP “with the telescope” in the sentence “The detective saw the man with the telescope” could mean that the detective used the telescope to see the man or that the man he saw had a telescope. Using a reading time paradigm, this study investigates Korean-English bilinguals’ processing of PP-attachment ambiguities involving two kinds of prepositional objects, which may differ in argument status: dative recipients (“the man” in “John gave a letter to his son to the man”) and instruments (“a lid” in “Sarah sealed the container with glue with a lid”).

For instance, men â€œlead,â€ and women â€œfollow.â€ In this presentation, I examine an interview with a current ballroom dance teacher about gender performance in his student-teacher interactions. I discuss how these student-teacher interactions continually reinforce the current gender dynamics not only in the dance studio but also in every other aspect of the ballroom dance industry. Through looking at the teacher's student-teacher interactions with Professional-Amateur (Pro-Am), social, and competitive dance students, it is arguable that gender performance in the American ballroom dance workplace is largely dictated by the American public's demand for dance instruction and by the use of traditional gender roles within actual dance performance/competition.Women in Writing: It's a Man's World",2010,s Studies,Women's and Gender Studies

Our lab is interested in using Activity-induced Manganese MRI (AIM MRI) to identify potential sites of neurogenesis in an invertebrate model, a crustacean called Cherax destructor. AIM MRI cannot directly visualize the production of new neurons; however, new neurons normally appear in activated regions of the brain. AIM MRI uses the contrast agent manganese, Mn2+, to visualize activated regions of the crustacean's brain. Mn2+ travels through the blood-stream and is taken up by tissues through calcium-gated ion channels. When synapses fire, the activity of calcium-gated ion channels increases, which leads to an elevated uptake of Mn2+. The regions with increased Mn2+ concentrations produce areas of increased intensity in MRI images.

The theorized root of the disease was the inherent frailty of women: too much strenuous activity was thought to cause a host of ailments, from anxiety and sleeplessness to delirium, to vaginal lubrication and other signs of sexual arousal. The diagnosis pathologized sexual desire in women, and treatment often included isolation or sexual violation. Even the threat of diagnosis was enough to enforce the Victorian ideal of female passivity by deï¬ning inappropriate behavior. The concept of hysteria was so fraught with gender stereotypes that it crossed the line from a true medical condition to a tool doctors used to forcibly controlWomen's bodies. By placing severe limitations on women as a sex, the hysteria diagnosis reinforced Victorian social norms and helped to keep women intellectually, sexually, and socially subordinate to men.",2013,Unspecified,Women's and Gender Studies

Across diï¬€erent sign languages, signers shift their torso to one side or the other to express referential shift. Although the body shift ironically depicts a character shift, it depends on the signer consistently placing characters in the same space across a narrative. We examined whether signers of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua use the body shift as a referential shift device. In the Nicaraguan deaf community, the younger signers introduce grammatical features that the older signers are unable to acquire. Deaf Nicaraguans' descriptions of six videos were coded for consistency in marking spatial relations and for the use of the body shift. Younger signers used the body shift and consistently marked spatial relations more often than older signers.

In the novel Stowe pronounces evils of slavery while providing stereotypical depictions of black characters. Stowe's sentimental writing style results in her attributing a great deal of sentimental integrity to the African race. This is countered by her belief in racial essentialism. The end result? An anti-slavery novel that is benevolently racist, esteeming the African race while carefully assuring the superiority of white America. These factors, as well as others, are responsible for making Uncle Tom's Cabin a novel that galvanized a nation and caricatured a people, which is perhaps why it is one of the most telling and meaningful works of American literature today.",2010,English and Classical Civilization,English

Consequently, Japanese society was fraught with tensionâ€”tension between East and West, tradition and modernity, the government and the individual, and public and private personas. Postcard images of women were part and parcel of the tensions that occurred as Japan sought out a new modern identity. Women, as the symbolic face of the nation, were at the center of the debates about the direction of Japanese society. The diversity of these postcard images is indicative not only of the renegotiation of Japanese society at this time, but also of the active role postcards played in helping transcend previous social boundaries by oï¬€ering women new identity options.

What constitutes forgiveness, who is eligible for forgiveness, and what wrongdoings are â€œfor-givableâ€ are all questions that have attracted the attention of politicians, philosophers, psychologists, and political scientists.

One popular explanation for this development is that reserves can serve as a self-insurance tool to insulate domestic economies from foreign adverse shocks. As economies have become more ï¬nancially integrated, the potential for sudden reversals in capital ï¬‚ows and the international transmission of ï¬nancial stress has increased as well. Therefore, it is especially important to assess the eï¬€ectiveness of reserves as a self-insurance policy tool. This study empirically investigates whether countries with higher levels of reserve assets were able to better withstand the shock from the U.S. subprime crisis. Speciï¬cally, we use sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) as an indicator of ï¬nancial vulnerability and analyze the relationship between CDS spread movements and reserve accumulation.",2010,Economics and Political Science,Economics

As part of an ongoing investigation into the antitubercular properties of novel thioureas, the preparation and propertiesof 1-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)arylthioureas were examined. 1-(4-Methylpiperazin-1-yl)thioureas are prepared in the reaction of 1-amino-4-methylpiperazine with an aryl isothiocyanate usually in good yields and without byproducts. Success of reactions is easily evaluated using NMR and IR spectra due to distinguishing features of the resulting thiourea group.

Loss of habitat connectivity results in reduced migration rates, causing remnant populations to become isolated and susceptible to extinction. This project will study patterns of genetic variability of weevil populations across volcanoes in the island of Isabela in the GalÃ¡pagos. The signals of habitat fragmentation due to indiscriminate goat grazing would demonstrate more severe eï¬€ects on the population genetic architecture in Northern than Southern Isabela.

However, because all cells in the niche appear to be migrating to their ï¬nal destination in the brain, it remains a question how the niche is replenished with new precursor cells. Our current hypothesis suggests that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are migrating from the bloodstream to the niche via a vascular cavity.

Yet, why these trends continue or what people of marriageable age think about these phenomena remains under explored. In my thesis I study college-aged women and their expectations for their future relationships. My working hypothesis has been that children of divorce, regardless of their socioeconomic background, are more likely to have polarized expectations regarding their relationships: they are more likely to be completely commitment-averse or commitment-demanding; they are more likely to have thought about divorce in their futures (either as a deï¬nite occurrence or a complete impossibility); they are less likely to believe in â€œthe oneâ€ (i.e, a soul mate); and they are more likely to expect a partner to break oï¬€ a relationship unless they are shown complete and absolute devotion. Early analysis of focus group data with 29 womenâ€”10 whose parents are divorce, 10 who identify their parents as happily married, and 9 who identify their parents as unhappily marriedâ€”reveals that women whose parents are unhappily married or divorced have more clearly deï¬ned future plans and are more pessimistic about eventually ï¬nding someone with whom they can spend their entire lives.

A close examination, however, of the policies the CCP has used to manage Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia makes it clear that all is not as it seems when it comes to the Chinese state's rhetoric and their actual policies towards these historically minority-dominated areas.

At the beginning of the decade the UN answered this call with increased zeal, eager to deï¬ne its role in the new world order. Large-scale humanitarian crises had always existed, but with the end of the Cold War and the U.S.-Soviet deadlock in the Security Council, the UN saw its opportunity to ï¬nally play a more dominant role in the international arena. However, as the decade progressed the UN became less willing to intervene, leaving some crises unattended while acting to prevent others.

One challenge in understanding this observation is limitations imposed by the use of categorical assessments of human facial variation. Here we develop a morphometric protocol for assessing the morphological diï¬€erences between high-resolution 3-D scans of human faces. Rather than treating faces categorically, this approach considers human faces as complex geometric landscapesâ€”consisting of landmarks, pseudo-landmarks and semi-landmarks â€”that diï¬€er in size and shape. By quantifying the size and shape differences present between any two 3-D facial scans, it is possible to more systematically assess not just whether two faces are diï¬€erent but how diï¬€erent they are and in what ways they are diï¬€erent. This in turn allows for greater interrogation of what kinds of diï¬€erences subjects observe when they examine the human face.","2011, 2012","Biological Sciences and Anthropology, Anthropology",Anthropology

A methods study was used to question whether the geochemical analysis methods of X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) can be successfully applied to determine the mineral composition of mixed siliciclastic-carbonate beaches in comparison to the traditional point counting method. Test sands comprised of quartz, coral fragments, shells, amphibole, and magnetite from Vieques, Puerto Rico were used. The range of grain sizes and differential weathering patterns of minerals in the sands complicates analytical methods. Analysis of error in each of the three methods was informed by a calibration study of sands comprised of known quantities of quartz and carbonate. Modifications on the traditional point counting method have produced an improved methodology, which incorporates the strengths of both the chemical and traditional analysis methods while also minimizing overall analytical expenditure.",2011,Geosciences,Geosciences

This project uses prenatal cetacean specimens from museum collections to examine this developmental transformation. DNA sequencing was used to confirm the species identity of museum specimens. A data set of external prenatal morphology and size by age was assembled from the whaling and scientific literature, allowing estimation of gestational age. CT scans performed at Children's Hospital documented the morphology of the developing osteological tissues by generating images using software that allows density-based differential coloring.

Sometimes, a single population may exhibit different body forms in different environments. If these alternate forms are adapted to their specific environments, this may further their divergence and they may someday split into new species. Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) in Lake Waban exhibit such anatomical differentiation, with shallow and open-water fishes having slightly different forms. These two forms also exhibit adaptive differences in swimming performance in their respective habitats. I examined the functional morphology of shallow and open-water bluegill, to determine if specific differences in internal morphology contribute to adaptive performance differences.

While many insects develop their adult legs from internal tissues called imaginal discs, more basal insects develop their adult appendages from external larval legs. Although the mechanism underlying leg development in highly derived insects is well understood, that governing adult leg transformation in more basal insects is not clear. To investigate the mechanism underlying larval to adult leg transformation in basal insects, leg development in the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, was examined through functional studies of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and the TGF-ë_ family member dpp. Knockdown phenotypes strongly suggested that both Arm and Dpp are key regulators of postembryonic leg development. dpp knockdown also resulted in severe bodily clearing, indicating that dpp is also for fat metabolism.

Divisions of existing niche cells do not replenish the niche, but the niche increases in size over an animal's lifetime. Niche precursor cells must, therefore, originate from an outside source. It has been hypothesized that circulating stem cells of possible hematopoietic origin are migrating into the niche from the hemolymph, and previous lines of inquiry have suggested a relationship between cells circulating in the blood and niche cells in the brain. In an attempt to better define this relationship, we examined the effect of hematopoietic tissue removal on neurogenesis.

2094,2011,Independent or Interdependent? The Influence of Self-construal on Self-presentation,Taysir Mahmoud,Julie K. Norem,"Have you ever thought about how to perfectly phrase your Facebook status? Had to behave professionally for an interview? Tried to act a certain way to impress a new friend? These are examples of self-presentation tactics, the set of behaviors used in dayto- day interactions to manage impression formation in interpersonal relations. This study examines the relationship between self-presentation tactics and self-construal. is the set of thoughts and actions that define the relationship between self and society. To varying degrees we all exhibit both independent SC and interdependent SC. Those with more independent SC tend to have a stronger sense of individuality and emphasize unique intrinsic attributes, whereas those with a more interdependent SC tend to be more flexible and emphasize social belonging. Having a better understanding of how these two constructs are related can enhance our understanding of their influence on our daily interpersonal interactions.",2011,Psychology,Psychology
2095,2011,The Activity and Mechanism of Action of Three Novel Antimicrobial Peptides,Sara Spinella,Donald Elmore,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are polycationic molecules with selective bactericidal and/or anti-cancer activity, and play an important role in the immune system of many species. Our lab has designed three novel AMPs (DesHDAPs 1-3) based on characteristics known to confer potency to buforin II, a ë±-helical AMP that kills bacteria by translocating across cell membranes and binding to DNA. The goal of this study is to determine the antimicrobial potency, anticancer activity, bacterial selectivity, and translocation ability of DesHDAPs 1-3 and to relate these properties to the peptides' structural features. Like buforin II, DesHDAP1 shows activity against several bacterial strains, and its ability to cross lipid membranes is dependent on the presence of a key helix-breaking proline residue. In contrast, DesHDAPs 2-3 do not show significant translocation across lipid membranes and display more limited bactericidal activity. This research offers insight into design strategies for novel antibiotics.

2096,2011,Elucidating the Connections between Cytoplasmic Mitotic Cyclins and Cell Wall Integrity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Kaylyn Williamson,Jennifer Hood-DeGrenier,"The four partially redundant Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitotic cyclins, Clb1-4, mediate the transition between the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle by activating their cyclindependent kinase (CDK) binding partner. 4 concentrate in the nucleus but are also present at lower levels in the cytoplasm. When the cytoplasmic population is eliminated, cell wall integrity is compromised. To understand the molecular basis of this phenotype, our laboratory performed a phosphoproteomic screen that identified putative targets of cytoplasmic mitotic CDK activity. In this study, we aim to validate the results of this large-scale experiment. this study focuses on confirming that Bni4, a protein important for cell wall synthesis, is a mitotic CDK phosphorylation target. We also aim to identify Bni4 binding partners in the presence and absence of cytoplasmic mitotic CDK activity to better understand the proposed connections between the cell cycle and cell wall integrity.

2097,2011,When Cells Get Stressed: Characterizing the Interaction between Poly (ADP-ribose) and RNA-binding Proteins in the Stress Granule,Stephanie See,Paul Chang Biology (Massachusetts Institute of Technology),"Poly (ADP-ribose) (pADPr) is a post-translational modification implicated in virtually all cellular processes however its specific function in many biological pathways is still unknown. Our lab has recently shown poly ADPribosylation is involved in the stress response pathway, specifically in the nucleation and formation of cytoplasmic bodies called stress granules (SGs). SGs are stalled cytoplasmic translational complexes critical for stress response. SG machinery includes a number of proteins containing RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) that are largely responsible for binding mRNA transcripts during SG nucleation during periods of cell stress. Due to the structural similarities between pADPr polymer and single stranded RNA, we believe these RRMs bind may pADPr as well. By characterizing this binding interaction and describing a mechanism, we aim to better understand the role pADPr plays in stress granule formation. This binding interaction may implicate pADPr as RRM targets not only in the SG, but also in a wide variety of other cellular pathways.

The country stood as a pioneer in June 2004 when the government committed to the free provision ARTs for the adult public. Prior to this, ARTs were only available privately. While the provision of life-saving ART treatment has emerged as a central part of the medical and policy response to HIV/AIDS, little is empirically known about the welfare effects of this important intervention on children living with HIV-positive adults. Estimation of the intergenerational effects of ARTs can provide valuable insights into the return on international aid investments, resulting in better informed public resource allocation decisions.

Challenging the idea that justice can be summed up in terms of freedom or equality, Levinas's philosophy reasserts the importance of responsibility, and the ethical imperative to not just cooperate with others politically, but also to serve. To aid my discussion, I draw on the political philosophy of Enrique Dussel, who sees a similar potential in Levinas's thinking. The anarchic nature of his theory attempts to translate the magnitude of an ethical command to serve, such that  his brand of justice is not accomplished by any one political system, but is constantly perfected. s interpretation of Levinas opens a new way of talking about the ethical state not just as fair, but as responsible.",2011,Philosophy,Philosophy

2108,2011,Childrenäó»s Understanding of the Link between Sensory Perception and Knowledge,Ellyn Schmidt,Jennie Pyers,"Over the preschool years children come to understand the relationship between their senses and the knowledge those senses acquire. This development may be supported by sensory experiences or theory-of-mind development. We tested these alternatives by asking hearing and deaf children to identify which of two confederates knew the identity of a toy animal when confederates had differential perceptual access to the animal. In the ‰ÛÏseeing‰Û condition, only one confederate saw the animal, and in the ‰ÛÏhearing‰Û condition, only one confederate heard it. Hearing preschoolers performed equally well in both conditions. deaf preschoolers performed equally poorly in both conditions, but deaf kindergarteners succeeded in both. deaf children's greater experience with vision does not lead to an accelerated understanding of the seeing-knowing connection. Taken together, the data suggest that understanding the link between perception and knowledge is more closely related to theory-of-mind development than to experiential learning.

2110,2011,The Panic of 1907: The Impact of Trust Company Directorship on Firm Performance,Lily Zhou,Eric Hilt,"Panic of 1907 was a major financial crisis, with striking parallels to the crisis of 2008. As with the recent financial meltdown, the period preceding the 1907 panic saw rapid innovation and change within the financial system. A new type of bank, called a trust company, became an increasingly important financial intermediary. These firms accepted deposits and competed with commercial banks, and yet were not subject to the same regulatory scrutiny. Many of these trust companies became important lenders to industrial companies and railroads, and would place one or more of their directors on the boards of their client firms. The outbreak of the Panic of 1907 occurred following a series of scandalous revelations about the investments of some trusts, resulting in widespread runs on many of these firms. The connections between the trust companies that came under severe strain during the crisis, and their client firms, may have transmitted the financial crisis to nonfinancial companies. Using newly collected data, this thesis investigates whether corporations with close ties to trust companies were differentially affected during the panic.

Western history, British colonists built Tudor houses in exotic settlements, recreating their romanticized home in strange lands.

Its release is regulated by an endocrine pathway initiated by gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is broken down by neuropeptidases thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) and prolyl endopeptidase (PEP). We hypothesized that estradiol levels may correlate with or directly alter TOP and PEP, thereby explaining a role by which it regulates GnRH activity. In this study, fluorimetric activity assays were used to analyze how estradiol alters TOP and PEP enzymatic activity in several mouse brain regions involved in reproductive function. Immunohistochemical assays were also conducted to ascertain localization of TOP, PEP, and estradiol receptor alpha in order to observe how all three components influence each other in their expression and activity.

Wolfson,"Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is a peptidedegrading enzyme that occurs throughout the body, but its highest concentration is in the testes and brain. TOP has been shown to break down an important neuropeptide called gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in the brain. GnRH regulates steroid hormone production in gonads via the hypothalamicpituitary- gonadal axis. The current study was designed to determine whether TOP also has a local effect on the gonads of male mice. Male mice were injected subcutaneously with a TOP-specific inhibitor (JA-2) and compared to control animals that had not been treated. Animals were sacrificed at six weeks of age and samples of their blood, testes, and brain were collected. There was a trend towards higher circulating testosterone levels in the JA-2 treated mice. testes samples from JA-2 treated animals displayed greater TOP activity compared with the control. These results suggest that TOP acts peripherally to control gonadal function in males.

Jacob, and Chan Myae Myae Soe",Christopher Arumainayagam,"Radiation chemistry, the study of the interactions of high-energy radiation with matter, has extensive applications and implications in areas such as cancer treatment, waste management, astrochemistry, nuclear chemistry and the material sciences. The interaction of highenergy radiation with matter results in copious quantities of secondary low-energy electrons, which form distinct energetic species that are thought to promote a variety of radiation-induced chemical reactions. The majority of these secondary electrons have energies below 10 eV and react with matter through three mechanisms: (1) dissociative electron attachment (DEA), (2) electron impact excitation, and (3) electron impact ionization. Our goal is to examine the hypothesis that DEA is the primary dissociation mechanism for high-energy radiolysis in the condensed phase.

Most recently, compounds of this class have also shown to be efficacious as antiviral agents against H1N1, which causes Influenza A. While isoprenyl coumarins are ubiquitous in nature, their chemical nuances can be explored in order to conduct structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. To that end, our investigation has involved the design, synthesis and evaluation of a series of novel isoprenylated coumarin derivatives as potential antiviral and anticancer agents. Here we present the synthesis of a novel family of isoprenylated coumarin analogues with modifications targeted towards both the isoprenyl chain structure and the umbelliferone moiety. Based on SAR data, more extensive synthetic modifications to these synthesized analogues are slated for future studies.",2011,Chemistry,Chemistry

In order to determine the relative importance of both mechanisms in mitigating the degree of photoinhibition we quantified their roles in a wide array of plant species. an actin-depolymerizing agent) and dithiothreitol (a violaxanthin de-epoxidase inhibitor) were used to inhibit chloroplast movement and prevent zeaxanthin synthesis, respectively. We then determined the extent of photoinhibition in the absence of these photoprotective mechanisms under high light stress conditions. Since internal CO2 concentrations are the other important factor in determining photosynthetic behavior, we investigated the relationship between stomatal density and chloroplast movement using confocal microscopy.

Biofilms are groups of bacteria that aggregate and form a community where they excrete extrapolysaccharides that serve as a protective barrier between them and their environment. The formation of biofilms varies in differing conditions and the structure of the mature biofilms is indicative of their growth environments. A flow cell system was constructed to test various experimental variables, including flow rate, inoculum concentration and absence or presence of light. This system allows for the supply of media to a growing biofilm under controlled conditions. Internal structures within the biofilms were observed by confocal microscopy. Results from our research showed the classic ‰ÛÏmushroom‰Û structures as well as the presence of ‰ÛÏcavities.

We have previously characterized bud morphogenesis, cytokinesis, and cell wall integrity defects associated with cytoplasmic mitotic cyclin depletion. Bni4 is required for proper assembly of the chitin ring and is also involved in septum formation and the maintenance of bud neck integrity.

These emotional processing deficits are similar to a cognitive-affective deficit called alexithymia. Numerous studies have shown the correlation between emotional processing deficits and clinical eating disorders, yet there is a lack of research on subclinical eating disordered populations in relation to these deficits. The goal of this research was to study clinical and subclinical participants with high endorsement of negative eating attitudes. We hypothesized that individuals with high endorsement would be more likely to display cognitive-affective deficits similar to those of alexithymia, and perform poorly on a perceptual emotional recognition task. Results showed that emotional processing deficits did not predict negative eating attitudes in the subclinical group, but that cognitive-affective emotional processing deficits did predict higher negative eating attitudes in the clinical group.",2011,Psychology,Psychology

Based on diary entries made by parents of over 40 children, the child-imaginary companion relationship can be examined both quantitatively and qualitatively. These diaries offer an opportunity to explore the type of play that the children engage in with their imaginary companions, and show how the children interact with them. The relationships can be categorized as being either hierarchical or egalitarian. The type of relationship may be correlated with the type of imaginary companion that the child prefers, or perhaps with the child's age or gender.

English speakers use lexical prepositions such as ‰ÛÏin,‰Û ‰ÛÏon,‰Û and ‰ÛÏunder,‰Û ASL signers use iconic depictions of spatial relations more than lexical prepositions to represent the real-world objects in relation to one another. Thus young ASL signers might use spatial language differently to facilitate their understanding of spatial relationships. Ten deaf children in an ASL-English preschool program completed two spatial mapping tasks that involved an understanding of similarity between two identical setups, a spatial language production task and a spatial language comprehension task. s scores on the cognitive tasks were significantly correlated with the complexity of their spatial language production and with their comprehension of spatial language in ASL.

2165,2011,Are Deaf Nicaraguan Signers Borrowing Facial Gestures from Hearing Nicaraguans?,Catherine Jaramillo and Andrea Akemi Takahesu Tabori,Jennie Pyers,"is a rapidly developing language that has recently incorporated grammatical markers produced on the face. When asking questions the youngest signers furrow their brows and lift their chins more than older signers, suggesting that younger signers are introducing these elements into NSL. The current empirical study examines whether these grammatical facial expressions are borrowed from the facial gestures produced by hearing Nicaraguans when asking questions. Twelve adult Nicaraguans with normal hearing and no experience with NSL were videotaped asking a friend a series of questions. We coded for three facial gestures: brow furrow, chin lift, and nose wrinkle. We observed the use of all three facial expressions, and documented the use of two more: side head tilt and brow raise. The similarity between the subset of facial expressions produced by both groups, confirms that grammatical markers in NSL are being adapted from some, but not all, of the gestures used by hearing Nicaraguans.

2167,2011,Waggle Dance Communication and Genetic Diversity of Honey Bees,Emma Britain and Shaheen Rangwalla,Heather Attila,"Workers in a honey bee colony are from numerous genetic families because each honey bee queen mates with multiple males. It is known that colonies with multiple subfamilies of workers forage more and produce longer ‰ÛÏwaggle dances‰Û to advertise food sources in the environment; we determined some of the worker-level mechanisms that explain this phenomenon. We compared waggle dancing by foragers and the amount of pheromones that workers release as they dance to the genetic composition of colonies (i. whether colonies were genetically diverse or genetically uniform because of the insemination status of queens). Our findings will allow us to determine whether the multiple-mating behavior of honey bee queens improves a colony's foraging effort because individual workers in a genetically diverse colony produce more signals on a per worker basis than workers in a genetically uniform colony.

Androgens increase cell growth in prostate cancer. androgens can be broken down into metabolites, one of which is 3b-Adiol. This androgen metabolite binds to estrogen receptors and prevents the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture. such as estradiol, also bind to estrogen receptors, but do not elicit the same effect as 3b-Adiol. This study seeks to understand why 3b-Adiol, but not estradiol, has an anti-proliferative effect on prostate cancer cells through using a protein interaction assay to identify different proteins interacting with estrogen receptors when bound to either hormone. Studying proteins involved in this pathway will allow us to identify crucial players in the inhibition of cell proliferation in prostate cancer, and provide insight into the possibility of using 3b-Adiol as a candidate drug for prostate cancer treatment.",2011,Neuroscience,Neuroscience
2173,2011,MOER to the ER Story: An Alternative Mechanism for Estrogen Signaling in the Brain,Christina Sun,Marc J. Tetel,"The ovarian steroid hormones, estradiol (E) and progesterone, act in specific brain regions to regulate reproductive behavior and physiology. One function of E is the induction of progestin receptor (PR) expression in the brain, which is predominantly mediated by Estrogen Receptor-ë± (ERë±). E has more recently been found to also act via membrane ER and trigger rapid cellular events. The potential contribution of this novel mechanism of ER action to the expression of PR in the brain has not been investigated. To understand the role of membrane ER in estrogen signaling in vivo, a transgenic mouse expressing membrane only estrogen receptor-ë± (MOER) was developed by Ellis Levin (Pedram et al, 2008). MOER mice express only the ligand binding domain of ERë± at the plasma membrane. Using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, the present study addresses two questions: 1) Do MOER mice express membrane ER in the brain? and 2) Do MOER mice express E-induced PR in the brain?

Why are women so underrepresented in scientific fields? One possibility is that people assume that women lack the traits needed to be successful scientists. To test this, we investigated whether people associate success in the sciences with masculine traits more than feminine traits. We also assessed whether the association of masculine traits with scientific success was greater in some scientific fields than others. Because past research on stereotyping has shown that people tend to see occupations as requiring masculine traits to a greater extent when those occupations have a relatively high proportion of men, we predicted that stereotypes linking success in science to masculine traits would be most pronounced in sciences where there are relatively few women.

At the time it was only one of many protean artistic experiments taking shape at Black Mountain College, a hotbed of intellectual activity where artists' ideas circulated freely across the disciplines of music, dance, and the visual arts. Black Mountain fostered a collaborative setting for some of the most important creative minds of the second half of the twentieth century, yet during that summer their place in the American artistic pantheon was far from guaranteed.

The ritualistic aspect of the term kaji suggests divine bestowal, which can also be explained in the context of Shinto, an indigenous practice of worshipping kami (spiritual deities). However, the hidden nature of this practice evokes mysticism, often leading to its incorrect interpretations.

The traditional style of romance was in decline when the storming New Culture Movement that spread the ideas of westernized romanticism reformed Chinese literature and individualism as the means of resisting the feudalistic patriarchy that supported the structure of arranged marriage. But over the entire course of the twentieth century, the representation of love and intimacy went through a metamorphosis that showed the mingling of literature and politics, or the merging of the public life and private life. Love and intimacy could be revolutionized, repressed, or sanctioned. Through this paper, I would like to explore the topic through the discussion of four phases in the development of modern Chinese literature: 1) before the revolution, 2) the new culture movement, 3) the era of the Communist revolution, and 4) the post-Mao epoch. I have selected four authors to represent each of the literary eras I have addressed above: Wu Jianren, Ding Ling, Eileen Chang, and Chu Tienwen.

The way Chinese literature represents women has changed significantly during the twentieth century. Wu Jianren's The Sea of Regret was one of the first Chinese novels to feature a female protagonist. Later, other leading male writers like Lu Xun and Shen Congwen promoted women's liberation in their writings. However, although women had been trying to achieve equality by writing since before the twentieth century, it was only in the middle of the century that female writers like Ding Ling and Eileen Chang became as respected as male writers. Eventually, Chinese feminism transitioned into appreciating each woman's individuality, femininity, and sexuality, as shown in the works of contemporary women writers such as Xi Xi and Zhu Tienwen. Through analyzing these works, I will explore the intricate interactions between the transforming literary modernity and the evolving status of feminism in modern China.

Although this change in form is often thought of as a process that occurs primarily in insects, humans also undergo a less drastic transition during puberty. The hormonal basis of metamorphosis and puberty are very similar in that both are initiated and regulated by neurohormones of the brain. In vertebrates, POU domain transcription factors (TF) have been linked to neuroendocrine changes associated with puberty. In order to better understand the processes of metamorphosis and puberty, we are investigating the function of a homolog of the POU domain TF, ventral veins lacking (vvl), found in the holometabolous insect, Tribolium castaneum. The link between vvl and key insect hormones, including the steroid hormone ecdysone and juvenile hormone, will be discussed. (Research supported by NSF.)

Temperature and gene expression were manipulated to understand how phenotypic plasticity was regulated in the abdominal melanic pigmentation of milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus. A higher temperature induced lighter abdominal melanic pigmentation and a lower temperature induced darker pigmentation in abdomens of milkweed bugs. The knock-down of Abdominal-B caused extra melanic pigmentation in a segment that normally lacked pigmentation and the knock-down of abdominal-A resulted in almost pigment-less abdomen. The knock-down of Tyrosine Hydroxylase resulted in complete loss of pigmentation from the body. We hypothesize that Abd-B is a repressor and abd-A a promoter of melanic pigmentation. Moreover, TH must be required for the development of melanic pigmentation in general.

Albertine's identity resists fixity because her expressions (gestures, actions, speech) lend themselves to mutually incompatible interpretations; consequently, Marcel is challenged to assemble a narrative that will render her expressions intelligible while cohering with their true significance. There are two methods by which Marcel can develop knowledge of Albertine's essential identity: he must (1) compel her to reciprocate his desire, or (2) paradoxically release her from scrutiny to become a stranger.

To determine how queens prepared for liftoff and how worker-produced signals facilitate this process, swarming was induced in colonies and queens were monitored through the process for pheromone production and changes in body temperature and activity level. These queen metrics were related to simultaneous activities of workers in the swarm. Our study provides insight into the mechanisms that prepare queens for liftoff and for keeping airborne swarms cohesive. ",2012,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences
2233,2012,"Studying the Biology of Wolbachia, the Male-hating Bacteria",," Heather Mattila, Biological Sciences","The Wolbachia bacterium is a reproductive parasite of insects that promotes the survival of female offspring to the detriment of male offspring. Wolbachia is extraordinarily widespread (infecting 60-80% of insect species) and also of medical relevance for the potential it holds as an insect vector control agent and drug target for filarial nematodes. However, little is known about how the bacterium interacts with its hosts. In this study, we studied proteins putatively used by Wolbachia for host interaction through three different techniques: 1) expression in yeast, a model eukaryote, to identify the molecular mechanisms used by Wolbachia to manipulate its hosts, 2) elucidating the function of these proteins by using bioinformatics (comparing them to well-characterized proteins) and 3) identifying their localization within the yeast cell. We identified 10 candidate Wolbachia effectors. We are currently working on determining their localization in the eukaryotic cell. ",2012,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

Given that the islands are a dynamic conveyor belt of potential colonization platforms, we tried to establish a link between Stomion's evolutionary history and the geologic history of the islands that they inhabit. Using a multi-gene dataset, we elucidated a potential colonization pattern, explored the timing of the first colonization event, and considered the subsequent generation of diversity within the archipelago. In order to derive a more generalized pattern further explaining the mechanism of colonization and speciation in island archipelagos, we considered the age of diversification of Stomion and its colonization history in comparison to other species in the Galapagos Islands.",2012,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences
2235,2012,Comparing the Photoprotective Importance of Nonphotochemical Quenching across a Range of Plant Species ,," Martina Koniger, Biological Sciences","While light is the driving force of photosynthesis, excess light can be harmful. As sessile organisms exposed to often drastically fluctuating light intensities, plants have evolved several mechanisms for maintaining the delicate balance between maximizing photosynthetic yield and minimizing photooxidative damage. The xanthophyll cycle allows plants to quickly transition from a state of high photochemical efficiency to one of cautious photoprotection upon changes in light conditions. The associated photoprotective state, known as nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), prevents photodamage by innocuously dissipating excess absorbed light energy as heat. We compared the capacity of a range of species to perform NPQ and quantified its photoprotective importance by comparing the abilities of leaves treated with dithiothreitol, a xanthophyll cycle inhibitor, and untreated leaves to recover from high light stress. Ultimately, we hope to better understand photoprotection in plants by comparing our results to data describing the importance of chloroplast movement, another prominent photoprotective strategy.

2236,2012,Tip Growth: Assessing the Functional Equivalence of COW1 in A. thaliana and P. patens ,," T. Kaye Peterman, Biological Sciences","Tip growth, or polarized cell expansion, produces cellular morphologies characterized by an outgrowth extending from a main body. Tip growth processes involve membrane trafficking to a specific growing point during cellular morphogenesis, and the resulting structure frequently allows for specialized cellular function. The model bryophyte Physcomitrella patens is an optimal system for tip growth studies. A previously characterized COW1 mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana individuals manifests a phenotype consistent with a tip growth defect (Grierson et al. 1997). Three putative COW1 homologs were identified in the P. patens genome based on sequence similarity, and a cross-species complementation study is underway to assess the functional similarities of these homologs to COW1. Identification of a functionally equivalent COW1 homolog in P. patens would suggest that its tip growth-specific function arose early in the evolution of land plants, and provide a conveniently simple model for investigating tip growth processes in the laboratory.

2237,2012,Catching Nemo: Fish Escape Strategies and Performance ,," David Ellerby, Biological Sciences","Successful predator evasion is essential for the survival of many animals. Performance, and therefore escape success and evolutionary fitness, is strongly influenced by both morphological and behavioral factors. Bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus) found in Lake Waban exhibit morphological differences based upon habitat. Shallow water fish have deeper body shapes, a morphology associated with increased escape performance. We therefore hypothesized  that these fish would exhibit greater fast start performance than the more streamlined deep water form. Behavioral strategies also influence escape success. For example, random, unpredictable escape directions may confuse predators, but limit specialization to maximize performance. Escape performance was analyzed from high-speed video recordings. Contrary to our predictions, deep water fish had significantly higher peak velocities and accelerations. Escape directions were also non-random. Each fish showed two or more preferred directions, but with enough variation to preserve unpredictability.",2014,Psychology,Biological Sciences
2238,2012,Determining the Importance of Two Photoprotective Mechanisms in Arabidopsis thaliana When Exposed to High Light Stress Treatments ,," Martina Koniger, Biological Sciences","In order to study the relative importance of chloroplast movement and the xanthophyll cycle as photoprotective mechanisms utilized by Arabidopsis thaliana we determined the photochemical efficiency of photosystem II before and after 90 min of high light exposure. We performed these treatments on WT and mutants that show partially reduced photoprotective abilities (npq1, phot2, phot1/phot2). In addition, we used inhibitors to selectively disable one or the other photoprotective mechanisms. As an actin-depolymerizer, cytochalasin B inhibits chloroplast movement and resulted in reduced high light stress tolerance. A. thaliana WT exhibited the greatest difference in recovery when comparing the control and cytB treated leaves, while A. thaliana phot1phot2 leaves showed the smallest difference. We will discuss the relative importance of these two mechanisms. ",2012,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

This social paradox is examined through diverse literature and a survey investigating how Korean and Korean-American youths identify themselves. Furthermore, focusing on gender and language use, we argue that sexual liberalization in Korean popular culture and the extensive use of expletives among youth highlight the discontinuity between the new and traditional Korean images.

Imagine a solitary man on horseback, perched on a lonely ridge, with his shining silver-star badge. Perhaps less typical of a bygone era of American history, this image fits more comfortably in the canon of popular culture and of Westerns. The classic imagery of the West endures as a powerful set of tropes in American culture. Moreover, they serve as a touchstone for the creation of idealized racialized or gendered figures. Continually revisited and revised for generations, westerns serve as a site of popular historical imagination, provide a stage for the depiction of contemporary social struggles, and comprise an evolving cultural arena ripe for analysis.

In my independent study, I have begun to explore how people locate themselves within an environment and how that sense of a place within the larger space of the world allows a certain identity to develop. I want to explore these three questions: have we lost something locating ourselves? Or do we locate ourselves to prevent feeling lost or disoriented? What does it mean to be someone somewhere? Through printmaking techniques involving lithography, intaglio, and relief methods, I explore how, by combining matrices and techniques, I can construct a layered but specific answer to these questions. I play with fragments of the grid and let scraps from a culturally shared memory, pieces of personal history, and larger swaths of place and time coexist to visually investigate who and where we are.

Other growth factors include the peptides neurotensin and gonadotropic releasing hormone (GnRH). Prolyl-endopeptidase (PEP), an endopeptidase, which is found in prostate cancer cells, is able to break down substrates such neurotensin and GnRH. In order to determine the effect of testosterone and estradiol on the level of PEP in prostate cancer cells, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells were treated with steroids for varying time periods. Our results indicate that the level of PEP in the cells is affected by the presence of androgens. There is a marked decrease in the level of PEP present in the cell after the cells have been exposed to dihydrotestosterone for one hour, suggesting that the effects of androgens are most felt with a limited exposure of the cells to androgens.

In order to study TOP in systems of hormone regulation, we have treated prostate cancer cells with three different hormones: dihydrotestosterone, estradiol, and 1:30-2:40pm gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The effects of these treatments on changes in TOP levels and location in the cells may help demonstrate what TOP's role is in such systems. To date, we have found an increase in TOP in the prostate cells after incubation with both dihydrotestosterone and estradiol, and little effect with GnRH treatment. Estradiol treatment also appears to increase nuclear TOP. (Research supported by the Roberta Day Staley and Karl A. Staley Fund for Cancer-Related Research.) ",2013,Biological Chemistry,Chemistry

Because the processing of peptide precursors occurs both inside and outside the cell, many peptidases must exist intracellularly and extracellularly to fully modulate peptide substrates. The pepidase enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) has been localized on the plasma membrane outer surface and in the supernatant of cell cultures. Recent advances highlight the biological relevance of microvesicles (MVs), plasma membrane bleb formations, which may carry away membrane-associated molecules (i.e. proteins) upon dissociation from the parental cell. We asked whether TOP is carried by cellular MVs and thus exist in association with MVs extracellularly, specifically for our androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells. Cells were treated with the androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Western blot analysis revealed that TOP protein is indeed carried by the isolated cellular MVs of both untreated and DHT-treated prostate cancer cells.

Most protein aggregates resulting from mis-folded protein do not have common structural characteristics. Amyloids, however, form a highly conserved repetitive secondary structure.

We began to answer these questions in rats by recording action potentials from neurons in the frontal and parietal cortices, both of which have been implicated in different aspects of sensory stimulus recognition in primates. Previous studies have produced conflicting results regarding the location of neurons associated with behavioral detection, as opposed to encoding of stimulus parameters. To address this issue, we analyzed the extent to which neurons in each cortex accurately reflected behavioral detection and presence of target stimuli while rats performed an auditory detection task, and whether the activity of these same neurons was modulated by sensory parameters of the target stimulus. Our preliminary results suggest that the sensory detection network in rat cortex may be less functionally segregated than in the primate brain.

South Asia's religious history is also tremendous, with the region boasting significant populations of the world's major religions. Unfortunately, over the centuries, conflict has arisen amongst these different religious communities. My thesis explores whether the medium of theatre can successfully promote ideas of religious pluralism in South Asia. This research focuses on Mahesh Dattani's play Final Solutions, which tells the story of two Muslims seeking refuge in the home of a Hindu family during a communal riot in Gujarat, India. I have analyzed the play's potential to promote religious harmony by examining its characters and themes, the political climate during which it was written, reactions to both the Hindi and English versions of the play, and the success other mediums like film have had with addressing religious communalism.",2012,"Theatre Studies, South Asian Studies",Unspecified

Women in Japanese society very rarely achieve the high ranks within companies that are accessible to salaried men. Rather, it is socially accepted that a womans most important role is to bear children and to maintain the smallest unit of society-the household. Yet in spite of government efforts to encourage women to have children, the birth rate has been steadily decreasing. Japanese women are generally waiting longer to get married, some even forgoing marriage altogether. Where do women stand today?

Recent years have not only witnessed a resurgence of this film genre in China, Japan, as well as South Korea, but also a remaking of the very style that has typically been attributed to it, which results in noticeable changes in everything from cinematography and story to theme. Most importantly, however, is the portrayal of the warrior character itself in these new films.

Scott Fitzgerald). The aftermath of the War demanded that writers, including Ernest Hemingway, create literature that broke from the customary ways of storytelling. The form of Hemingway\s stories conveys how the War shattered ideals of love, religion, and battle. Hemingway\s In Our Time, an experimental collection of short stories and vignettes, fragments the cohesive narrative of the novel and plays with temporality, perspective, and voice in order to represent and express the iconoclastic consequences of the War. Meanwhile A Farewell to Arms represents a more coherent narrative through the single unified consciousness of Frederic Henry, but the collapse of past and present in his retrospective narration reflects the trauma of the War and responds to Ezra Pound\s charge to make it new.

Both authors were prolific writers, widely read in their own countries during their lifetimes, and remaining popular today. Using exaggeration, humor, and colorful characters, Dickens criticizes London society and its institutions. An avid reader, Galdos said that he considered Dickens his most well-loved teacher and was proud to be called the Spanish Dickens. Fortunata y Jacinta was noted for its blatant critique of the middle class in Madrid. Two cities, Madrid and London, play significant roles in the novels- offering chances, choices, opportunities, and limits impossible to overcome.

While the fullness of traditional rural life at Talbothays Dairy contrasts with the desolation of Flintcomb-Ash, the romanticized harmony of the dairy is limited. The alienation that characterizes modern farming later in the novel is in fact introduced while Tess is at Talbothays. My own experience working on farms drew me to examine this portrayal of nineteenth-century agriculture. Though Hardy firmly and convincingly critiques industrial agriculture in the novel, he resists the nostalgic idea that the past and the natural world offer idyllic alternatives to the unfulfilling present.

Electron microscope X-ray element maps were made to determine the spatial distribution of the minerals in four howardites. The mineral distributions from the large clasts and mineral fragments were compared to the distributions in the small clasts and mineral fragments. Under normal conditions in a well-mixed rock, the mineral proportions in each size fraction should be approximately equal. In addition, chemical analysis of the mineral pyroxene in each meteorite was performed.

In India, women seek biomedical obstetric care; in Tibet, most women give birth at home. Biomedical hegemony, kinship, and citizenship shape this dynamic. In Tibet, a mistrust of Chinese hospitals due to coercive reproductive regulation discourages women from accessing biomedical care. However, these anxieties come into tension with experiences of birth complications at home. In India, this tension is eased, since women emphasize their freedom to access reproductive health care. And, given the absence of kin networks to aid women throughout labor, many give birth in hospitals. By juxtaposing memories of childbirth in Tibet with experiences of childbirth in exile, my informants narratives point to the ways that reproduction figures as a symbol used to interpret ethnic, political, and familial belonging.

SES was hypothesized to be negatively correlated with stigma sensitivity, and with stress levels in terms of both perceived stress and stressful life events. Stigma sensitivity was also expected to moderate the relation between SES and stress. This moderation was tested through regression analyses. None of the hypotheses were supported, except that SES was negatively correlated with stigma sensitivity. Instead, stigma sensitivity was negatively and significantly correlated with stressful life events.

However, the authors observed positive correlations between co-rumination and both friendship satisfaction and perceived stress when only participants who reported high levels of co-rumination were considered.

Pronunciation errors occur because of differences in acceptable sounds in each language or in allowable sound combinations. Native Koreans learning English, for example, have difficulty differentiating between due to a lack of distinction in Korean. Therefore, words such as pen and pan prove difficult for learners. While errors in the L2 are accountable, pronunciation errors in the L1 are more unusual. To investigate L1 pronunciation errors, I analyze vowel production, studying melded vowels created by a combination of Korean and English phonemes.

Because neural activity generates voltage changes on the scalp, researchers can use this electrical activity to gain insight into cognition. Similar events generate characteristic voltage changes, called event-related potentials (ERP). For example, the P600 ERP component has historically been identified with syntactic processing. However, the noisy channel model deemphasizes syntax, and so predicts the cognitive activity generating the P600 is not processing syntax but rather inferring meaning when an utterance is likely an error.

The shapes of block connectors can be used to indicate type, but existing block languages handle only simple types and do so in an ad hoc and confusing fashion.

Lucian wrote during a period when education (paideia in ancient Greek) was an important marker of social status as well as a means of preserving the past. As a native Syrian, as opposed to ethnic Greek, his place in elite Greek-speaking society was dependent upon proving that he was educated, and he does this by drawing extensively from traditional classics of Greek literature and rhetoric. However, his works also reflect awareness of his status as an outsider and of the gap between the idealized past and present reality. In pieces such as Somnium (The Dream), Lucian cleverly subverts traditional themes and allusions in ways that question the validity of his self-representation and of paideia as an instrument of social status.",2012,Classical Civilization,Classical Studies

While French leaders after the war focused on the 75% of Jews saved during the war, history sees these statistics as a failure. The issue is not how many Jews Vichy saved but rather how many Jews Vichy ostracized, abandoned and deported. Without any German influence, the Vichy Regime passed anti-Semitic legislation that stripped French Jews of their citizenship and allowed for the internment and deportation of foreign Jews to camps in Eastern Europe. Post WWII, the French, united around a myth of a heroic French resistance, believed the crimes committed by Vichy were German crimes. Only in the 1960s was that myth shattered; French anti-Semitism, not Nazism, had driven Vichy's actions during the war. Through an examination of Vichy's actions and its subsequent effects on the Jewish community, it is possible to understand the transformation of Jewish identity in France.

Of the ten, the most populous are the Huizu or Sino-Muslims. Yet Huizu did not always exist as an ethnic category. As China transitioned from empire to modern nationstate in the twentieth century, new forms of identity emerged. Sino-Muslim intellectuals held different views about whether all Muslims in China comprised one nationality or were ethnically different while sharing one common religion. This internal debate provides the key to understanding how the terms Hui and Huizu underwent the curious transformation from a religious to an ethnic marker. Reevaluating Hui agency, my research examines the strategies used by Sino-Muslims to construct their collective identity and how these active efforts, in addition to state actions, contributed to the eventual recognition of an autonomous Hui nationality.

In the extreme, a few patients have recently been diagnosed with strains of tuberculosis that are completely unresponsive to currently-available drug therapy, heightening the urgency of developing new pharmaceuticals effective against drug-resistant strains. The thiocarbonyl moiety, present in several resistant strain therapies, is hypothesized to produce tuberculostatic activity. We endeavor to incorporate a thiocarbonyl into new tuberculostatic compounds via the thioamide or thiourea functional group. Alkyl-substituted thioamides were produced from substituted benzaldehydes and aromatic amines via a modified Willgerodt-Kindler reaction. Diphenyl thioureas were synthesized by nucleophilic attack of aniline derivatives on the electrophilic carbon of aryl isothiocyanates.

One narrative I reference focuses on the importance of being “shou,” or familiar, with somebody, and how “coming out” is not really necessary when you are “shou” with someone. Another narrative emphasizes the idea of “freedom,” and how departure from “home” is painted as necessary to achieve this “freedom.” Both of these narratives conceive of a queerness that is inseparable from ""Chinese-ness""; the meaning of the search for a ""home"" and a sense of belonging shifts depending on context.,

About half are reunited with a parent (but often return to the system) and the rest are adopted, emancipated or live with another relative. The race, religion, and social class of the host families in comparison to the children who enter the system will be discussed.

The Construction of Gender Relations in the American Automotive Industry Consumer Advertisements,
,
Roxana Mir ‘15, Women’s and Gender Studies and Neuroscience,
,
This study focuses on consumer advertising in the automotive industry as it relates to gender. A review of automotive advertisements from the 1950s reveals that they primarily showcased women’s role in the domestic sphere, which inevitably portrayed women as being subservient or secondary to men. In comparison, modern commercial advertisements are more sexualized and often focus on the physique of the woman’s body as opposed to the product itself. The aim of this study is to explore whether the ads from the 21st century are more reflective of the evolution of women’s role in the society or if they reiterate the same stereotypical narrative under the guise of sexual liberation. Furthermore, this study also aims to examine gay and lesbian advertising to see whether or not this form of advertisement upholds the masculine power complex inherent in gender relations through the redefinition of heteronormativity.",2013,Women's & Gender Studies,Women's and Gender Studies

Generally speaking, American prison conditions are terrible. In times of economic crisis, no elected officials want to sacrifice their positions by providing extra funding for those incarcerated in lieu of providing resources for their law-abiding constituents. How can we improve daily life for the more than 6 million people behind bars? Libertarians have proposed solutions based on free-market capitalism. One of the most prominent of these is a voucher system. Upon sentencing, prisoners are given vouchers and are allowed to choose from an array of prisons. The system will create competition among the prisons, and thus force them to improve conditions if they want to attract prisoners (or “customers”, in this example). My presentation focuses on the voucher system as a means to improveour incarnation system that is grounded in free-market and libertarian values.,

Although the behavioral components of learning and memory have been well characterized, the neuronal changes that accompany such behaviors are less understood. Songbirds are a unique model system for the investigation of learning and memory in the brain because they provide a natural learning paradigm that is expressed under laboratory conditions. Male, juvenile songbirds learn their songs from a conspecific tutor during a ‘sensitive period,’ and the strength of this learning can be measured after the learning process has been completed. Because of similarities at the behavioral level between song learning and speech learning, the songbird is also a particularly good model for speech acquisition in humans. In the Gobes Lab, we investigate the cellular and synaptic changes that occur during song learning in both wakefulness and sleep through behavioral, immunocytochemical, and electron microscopy techniques.

From a sociological standpoint, honor killings are a means for the restoration of societal equilibrium after a family’s honor has been stained by sexual impropriety. Honor killing is also a cultural practice that extinguishes an individual’s right to life in order to protect the collective identity and rights of a group. This presentation explores traditional notions of honor and dignity in relation to broader international human rights frameworks. I assess the practice of honor killings through the lens of what human rights theorist Jack Donnelley refers to as “weak cultural relativism.” I propose a ""minimal morality"" that seeks rapprochement between human rightsadvocates and proponents of honor-based violence. The ethics of a minimal morality seeks to allow members of groups who commit human rights violations to continue to cultivate their own cultural identity while also ensuring that the fundamental human right to life is protected.,

In 2012, the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, spoke to the United Nations in Geneva. In her speech, she advocated for the rights of the LGBT community, stating that gay rights and human rights are one in the same. Clinton’s speech came soon after the media uproar regarding Uganda’s proposed Anti-Gay Bill. With punishments ranging from a years in prison to perhaps even the death penalty, the proposed Anti-Gay bill would infringe on African peoples’ human rights. Same-sex relations are illegal in most African countries as well as in many Western countries, a fact which indicates that there are strong cultural traditions at work that govern diverse forms of human sexuality. Many have pointed to religious and cultural arguments to support Uganda’s proposed bill. However, an immense international backlash from the human rights community has put these issues in the spotlight. This presentation will focus on the tension between respecting cultural traditions and ensuring the protection of individuals’ basic human rights.,

In September 2010, President Sarkozy of France became heralded and hated after the passage of a law prohibiting the wearing in public of clothing covering the face, including burqas and niqabs. The law sparked a debate, in which both sides, the French government, and the Muslim community, have claimed to be operating under the principles of cultural universalism and cultural relativism. This case in France illustrates an ongoing tension between, on the one hand, universalist principles of freedom of expression and the state’s equal protection of citizens and, on the other hand, the claims that people have a right to practice their culture. For human rights organizers, the question becomes is it possible to ever reconcile this tension, and if so, how can you begin to practically do so?,

Women’s Rights in the Face of Acid Attacks: A Case Study of the Tensions between Relativism and Universalism,

Alice Liang, ‘16,
,
 Inela Selimovic, Spanish and Thomas Cushman, Sociology,
,
Individual members of Islamic fundamentalist groups in areas such as Gaza and Kashmir have recently thrown acid at women for not wearing hijabs, justifying their attacks as a response to the violation of Shari’a law. Not only do these attacks strip away a woman’s agency, they cause lifelong scars and stigmatization. Such violations of human rights pose an ethical dilemma. Leaving the issue unaddressed contributes to the perpetuation of systematic violence against women, yet imposing a universal standard of rights on a culture can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism. I argue that human rights and Shari’a law are not mutually exclusive. It is possible to protect women’s bodily rights, while respecting the cultural and religious context in which women live. Resolving the necessary tensions between universalism and relativism demands complex cultural negotiation. This presentation will explore strategies of stopping acid attacks within the context of powerful cultural inducements that normalize violence against women’s agency.,

Kaye  Peterman,  Biological Sciences","The plant vascular system accomplishes an incredible feat of carrying water and nutrients, sometimes for hundreds of kilometers. Vascular patterns must be rigid enough to supply the organism with vital water and nutrients, but also flexible enough to account for environmental changes. This self-assembling network begins to lay the groundwork during early embryogenesis when the embryo is patterned with procambial cells. The coordination of this replicable, yet adaptable pattern de novo in each leaf is associated with auxin hormone domains which predict the procambial cell differentiation.,

The patellins (PATLs) are Arabidopsis thaliana Sec14-related proteins that are thought to function in membrane trafficking (Peterman 2004). Recent phylogenetic studies suggest that the PATL family arose during the evolution of the first vascular plants. We investigate the connection of auxin domain establishment and PATL function in the plant vascular system using a number of molecular techniques.  ,

One important visual cue for perceiving depth is stereo. It is especially important to distinguish between foreground and background objects in the analysis of a scene. We reach first for objects in the foreground and recognize objects more easily when they appear in front. In my thesis, I conducted perceptual experiments that show that the human visual system analyzes foreground objects more quickly and accurately than background objects, when using stereo to perceive depth. I also developed a computer algorithm to analyze 3-D scene structure from stereo images, incorporating this knowledge that people process foreground and background objects differently. Using a multi-resolution approach that processes foreground objects at a higher resolution, this algorithm may reduce the computational resources needed to perform object segmentation without losing essential information about scene structure. ",2013,"Neuroscience,

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. In order to effectively improve pancreatic cancer outcomes, a highly targeted therapeutic is necessary.  An antibody-conjugated gold nanoparticle (AuNP) would provide such a therapeutic platform.  Effective targeting of the nanoparticle is possible through the linkage of monoclonal antibodies to target key antigens highly expressed in cancerous tissue.  Previous work using RT-PCR and Western blotting has established the high level expression of the transmembrane glycoprotein A33 (gpA33) in the CAPAN-2 PDAC cells and the absence of gpA33 in the BxPC-3 PDAC cells.  This differential protein expression allows for an experimental setup in which uptake of AuNPs conjugated with anti-gpA33 antibodies between CAPAN-2 and BxPC-3 tumors can be quantified and compared in vivo.  Using an ex ovo avian embryo culture, specific targeting of our current antibody-conjugated AuNP construct to CAPAN-2 xenografts has been demonstrated.",2013,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

The play engages with Aeschylus' Agamemnon; it is concerned with the same themes but gives them a radically different treatment. Euripides empties the Aeschylean 'house' of its symbolic content, traditionally the aristocratic family. Accordingly, Euripides' language is more concrete than Aeschylus', and his plot is driven by exterior rather than interior events. I bring out both qualities in my production of Orestes, which I staged in an original translation in April. The performance manifests onstage the most challenging aspects of Euripides' text and argues for the play's departure from tragic convention by staging the absence of an interior and employing the 'unreliable narrator' technique as a proxy for Euripides' play with genre. It also includes musical and scenic effects designed to bring the Greek tragic stage to a modern audience.",2013,"Classics,

Because the P3 response in humans is altered in a number of neurological disorders, it is important to understand its generators. To determine whether the rat brain shows an analogous P3 response with functionally distinct early and late subcomponents, we are recording frontal and parietal local field potentials from chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays, while rats are presented with tones in a passive condition or while they actively perform a simple auditory detection task. To the extent that rats and humans are similar in these processes, studies in the rat model could help us understand neural mechanisms of human attention.",2013,Neuroscience,Neuroscience

One of the ways we cope with the sizable influx of information is the process of selective attention. To investigate the neural correlates of attention, I have focused primarily on two EEG-like measures of attention that derive from neural oscillations, gamma-range power and coherence. To determine whether the rat brain shows increased gamma coherence and power during states of high attention analogous to human EEG studies, we have recorded local field potentials (LFPs) in the rat frontal and parietal cortex with chronically implanted multi-electrode arrays while the rat performs an auditory detection task. To further characterize our spectral data, we correlated response latencies with evoked gamma power and inter-area coherence. Through LFP comparisons and coherence analysis we hope to help establish the rat as a model of attention and perception analogous to that of humans.",2013,Biological Sciences,Neuroscience

In this study, 10-day-old mice with the verge gene (wild-type) and those without (knock-out) were used as a model of the human infant to test the hypothesis that verge improves stroke outcomes and angiogenesis in the ipsilateral hemisphere. Immunofluorescence studies were conducted to measure expression of CD105, an angiogenesis marker, and cresyl violet staining was performed to measure brain atrophy at different time points post-stroke.

Biofilms are cell aggregates, which act as a protective barrier by providing nutrient access, increased drug tolerance and metabolic by-product sharing. Biofilms can form both in nature and in human infections, where they are very antibiotic resistant and thus particularly difficult to treat. To form biofilms, many bacterial species use a communication system involving chemical signals. In this study, we investigate the cell-cell communication of this cyanobacterium. The physical structure of the biofilms is also being analyzed. The wild type non-motile cells form a uniform monolayer biofilm while the super-motile mutant cells form pillar shaped biofilms that spread across the surface.

Silencing Vvl expression resulted in precocious metamorphosis and a reduction in kruppel homolog 1 (kr-h1), a target of the key insect metamorphosis regulator Juvenile hormone (JH). However, topical application of JH on Vvl knockdown larvae delayed the onset of metamorphosis and rescued the normal expression of kr-h1.

I examine this phenomenon in the careers of the post-Soviet science-fiction authors Sergey Lukyanenko and Marina and Sergey Dyachenko. Their fictional writing is powerful because they can ask old questions in a context devoid of the reader’s stereotypes, prejudices, or past experiences. A recurring theme in Lukyanenko’s writing is the stark contrast between “us” and “others,” humans and aliens, or magicians living in present-day Moscow and “normal” people. An important theme in the Dyachenkos' work is forgiveness, as exemplified in their novels The Scar and Skrut. In sum, the modern Russian science-fiction protagonist is three-dimensional and flawed.

Throughout history, poor and the marginalized groups have found through folk songs ways to recreate, represent, and celebrate the actions of men and women that, while labeled as deviant or criminal, convey hopes for social change and community justice. Narco-corridos, a musical style popular throughout Northern Mexico, are ballads that describe people’s involvement in drug trafficking activities. The majority of the scholarly work on narco-corridos has focused on the study of male characters, ignoring or mentioning women only in passing. This presentation will discuss the roles women play in drug trafficking and the roles that have been constructed for them in narco-corridos over time,

Zines can be powerful medium for self-narratives. Self-published and creator-distributed, they can break the molds of traditional publishing and make room for creative tellings of marginalizedstories. In a final project for Crossing the Border(s), a Chicana/Latina theory and literature class, students were challenged to create their own self-narratives. Starting by positioning myselfwithin the discourse of feminist and queer scholarship, I specifically consider the work of Chicana feminist poet, writer, and cultural theorist, Gloria Anzaldúa. This zine explores the construction of memory through complex family history and memory's function in the creation of self. It focuses on thecreation of solidarity ideologies through experience and identity, and its material manifestations. Finally, it considers the act of writing as the theorizing work necessary for survival in the margins.,

Why Hip-Hop is Queer: Using Queer Theory to Examine Identity Formation in Rap Music,
,
Although many believe hip-hop is irredeemably misogynistic and homophobic, hip-hop actually provides a unique space for queer interpretations of identity. Rap music is a poetics and a politicsin which construction of oppositional narratives and presentation and performances of race, gender, and sexuality is possible. The works of hip hop artists Azealia Banks, Frank Ocean, Las Krudas, and Big Freedia particularly illuminate the processes of identity formation and presentation. Using queerness to examine hip-hop, and using hip-hop to examine queerness demonstrates the significance of hip-hop as a cultural production and social movement.,

Female bodies were subjected to a persistent economic and ideological valuation by the varied actors who participated in the market – slave, trader and planter – who commodified and attempted to dehumanize the slave, necessarily and intentionally reducing enslaved women “to the simplicity of a pure form: a person with a price.” 1 By considering the valuation and ownership of productive and reproductive labors as the abolition of the trade loomed imminent, this project considers the ways in which enslaved women countered this process, shaping their sense of self and exercising personal agency within the confines of the market. ,

Despite such convergence of taste, substantial individual differences also exist. In a study involving 316 twin pairs, we explored the degree to which genetic and environmental factors influence the uniqueness of individuals' beauty preferences. The question was: What makes people more or less unique in who and what they find attractive? Our findings suggest that genes have minor influence, if any, on the uniqueness of one’s taste for faces, abstract objects, and real world scenes. Rather, most individual variations in preferences are the result of unique personal experiences. Interestingly, age and gender were not significant predictors of how idiosyncratic an individual’s beauty preferences were. Results suggest that our quirky aesthetic preferences are large attributable to our unique experiences. ",2013,"Psychology,

In most individuals, escape angles cluster around two or three preferred directions. This may be a behavioral strategy that limits the predictability of escape behavior. It may also be driven by underlying biomechanical constraints; this being the case, there may be performance benefits associated with the preferred trajectories. To test this we compared performance, as indicated by peak velocity, peak acceleration, and distance moved, between escapes performed at preferred versus infrequently chosen directions. There were no differences in performance in relation to escape angle. This suggests that the observed escape angle distribution is largely associated with behavioral factors, rather than dictated by proximate factors relating to escape performance.",2015,Unspecified,Biological Sciences

The effects of E and P are mediated by their respective receptors, estrogen receptor (ER) and progestin receptors (PR) which are transcription factors. E induces the expression of PR, which are expressed as two isoforms: full length PR-B and the shorter PR-A. These two PR isoforms, PR-A and PR-B, have profound functional differences in physiology and behavior. Members of a family of steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs), SRC-1 and SRC-2, facilitate the transcriptional activity of PR. In the present study, we investigate whether SRC-1 or SRC-2 are differentially expressed with the PR isoforms in mouse brain. We used triple label immunohistochemistry in PR transgenic isoform specific knock-out mice. The results of our study will bring us closer to understanding how steroid receptor coactivators contribute to the differences of the mouse PR isoforms in brain and behavior.",2013,Neuroscience,Neuroscience

Hedgehog (HH) is a major signaling pathway found in most, if not all, animal species, including humans. In vertebrates, HH signaling has been shown to play key roles during limb regeneration. To determine whether Hedgehog might also play a role during limb regeneration in Tribolium castaneum, HH signaling was silenced through RNA interference. HH silencing resulted in a complete loss of leg and antenna regeneration, indicating that the HH signaling pathway is necessary for the initiation of regeneration. Specifically, HH appears to be necessary for the growth of the blastema that forms at the ablation site. Studies on the role of Hedgehog in blastema proliferation and re-patterning of regenerating legs are currently underway. Overall, our findings suggest that HH signaling is a conserved mechanism for appendage development and limb regeneration across Metazoa.",2013,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

We also assess the differences in response latency to stimuli of identical luminance but different saturation and hue, to test the possibility that these dimensions are encoded by temporal dynamics. Preliminary results show latency to be inversely related to saturation. ",2015,Neuroscience,Neuroscience

,
 ",Sarah D Finkelstein,"Marc  Tetel,  Neuroscience","Sixty percent of diabetics develop some form of diabetic-neuropathy. Diabetic-neuropathy is the neuronal death of peripheral nerves, such as the sciatic nerve, due to the degradation of myelin, the protective protein surrounding the nerves. Schwann cells produce myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Interestingly, progesterone, an ovarian steroid hormone, causes an increased production of an important protein in myelin by binding to progestin receptors (PR) and recruiting steroid receptor coactivators, such as SRC-2. Estradiol, another steroid hormone, mediates the expression of PR in steroid-sensitive tissues. My study investigates whether PR are estradiol-induced in the female rat sciatic nerve using antibodies that tag PR and SRC-2 in the sciatic nerve of  rats treated with estradiol. Co-localization of PR and SRC-2 in the same cell provides neuroanatomical evidence for their interaction and will enhance our understanding of the protective role of progestins in diabetic-neuropathy in females.,

When a discrete switch exists in the phenotypes produced in response to a continuously varying environmental input, the plastic trait is known as a polyphenism. Developmental hormones, such as ecdysone and juvenile hormone (JH), are known to control polyphenisms, but the origins of polyphenisms remain poorly understood. Ventral abdominal spot patterning of Oncopeltus fasciatus, the milkweed bug, is an example of a temperature-dependent phenotypically plastic trait. Using double-stranded RNA injections, we knocked down the expression of the Hox genes abdominal-A (abd-A) and Abdominal-B (Abd-B), JH receptor Methoprene-tolerant (Met), and nuclear hormone receptors Ecdysone receptor (EcR) and Fushi tarazu factor-1 (FTZ-F1) to explore the genetic and hormonal mechanisms of abdominal pigmentation.

The low survival rate and lack of surgical options for many cancer patients has necessitated the development of highly specific and potent potential drug therapies.  Nanoparticles, spherical particles with diameters an order of magnitude smaller than wavelengths of visible light, are ideal for cancer therapeutics due to their small size, low toxicity, and high surface area to volume ratios. Our project focuses on the surface modification of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles to achieve biocompatibility and targeted drug delivery. Nanoparticles are characterized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine their quality as contrast agents for tracking in vivo.  Recent work has focused on coating iron oxide particles with silica and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to increase biocompatibility along with the conjugation of nanoparticles to monoclonal antibodies for targeting pancreatic cancer cells.  (Research supported by Roberta Dey Staley Fund for Cancer Related Research, Sophomore Early Research Program, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)).,

One percent of the global population suffers from Schizophrenia, a chronic brain disorder that leads to behavioral, cognitive and social abnormalities. Although no specific cause has been identified, environmental, genetic and epigenetic factors have been implicated as possible factors. Our study attempts to validate a genetic and epigenetic mouse model for schizophrenia, GCPII/AAV. These mice have a genetic mutation that is hypothesized to cause diminished levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate, in hopes of modeling glutamate receptor dysfunction. We introduced a histone deacetylase enzyme to newborn mice to elicit epigenetic dysregulation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Diffusion Tensor Imaging are used to examine volumes of brain regions and the structural integrity of white matter tracts. A behavioral paradigm is also employed to test the mice’s sociability. Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy was used to analyze neurometabolite levels.

Longevity, onset of foraging, and time spent waggle dancing by workers were compared between treatment groups.

Biofilms are how bacteria naturally exist in nature--enclosed in an extracellular matrix of protein and polysaccharides. The biofilm state protects bacteria against environmental stressors, such as antibiotics and biocides. Confocal microscopy was used to analyze the development of biofilms of two strains of Synechocystis sp. strain 6803, a wildtype and motile mutant, which were grown in flow cells. A significant difference was found in terms of their biofilm structures and growth, with wildtype biofilms being lower in height and not exhibiting dense clusters compared to the motile strain. The genomes of both strains were sequenced and then characterized for genetic differences. We also explored the ability of the motile mutant to move towards light, known as positive phototaxis. Our goal was to find the physical conditions required for maximal positive phototaxis in the motile strain. ,

The enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) has the ability to cleave many peptides integral to important biological processes.  One of these is gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), levels of which control the amounts of estrogens and androgens the body produces.  To determine the role TOP may play in control of androgen and estrogen production, I treated human prostate cancer cells with varying concentrations of &beta;-estradiol, an estrogen, and evaluated how this treatment affected cellular TOP levels and localization.  Androgens and estrogens have enormous influence on human reproductive function and behavior, and abnormal regulation of these hormones contributes to many diseases.  If it is true that TOP influences the production of androgens and estrogens, TOP could be an important component in the process of human reproductive regulation. Funded by the Roberta Day Staley and Karl A.

Many bacterial species, including the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. Strain PCC 6803, use the formation of biofilms as a survival mechanism. Biofilms are cell aggregates, which act as a protective barrier by providing nutrient access, increased drug tolerance and metabolic by-product sharing. Biofilms can form both in nature and in human infections, where they are very antibiotic resistant and thus particularly difficult to treat. To form biofilms, many bacterial species use a communication system involving chemical signals. In this study, we investigate the cell-cell communication of this cyanobacterium. The physical structure of the biofilms is also being analyzed. The wild type non-motile cells form a uniform monolayer biofilm while the super-motile mutant cells form pillar shaped biofilms that spread across the surface. Our goal is to gain a better understanding of this ubiquitous and diverse bacterial survival strategy. Research supported by a Jerome A. Schiff Fellowship.,

Chloroplasts perform a variety of critical functions in plant cells, including lipid metabolism, protein synthesis, and photosynthesis.  For the cell to operate smoothly, these important functions must be effectively integrated and regulated with other processes in the cell.  This necessitates the existence of extensive intracellular communication networks.  Recent work in a variety of organisms has revealed that networks of protein-protein interactions form the core of most intracellular communication. Efforts to understand how the chloroplast fits into the plant cell’s protein-protein interaction network require an accurate inventory of the chloroplast outer envelope protein population (proteome), which we have worked toward by developing methods to isolate this membrane and identify proteins by mass spectrometry.  To detect protein-protein interactions between the chloroplast and other cellular proteins, we have used protein microarray technology with intact chloroplasts as the probe.  We have also used bioinformatic tools to generate a virtual chloroplast outer envelope interactome. ",2013,Biological Chemistry,Chemistry

2528,2013,Medieval Nonsense Verse: Contributions to the Genre,Bridget E Begg,"Matthew  Sergi,  English","Good nonsense creates a multitude of tensions; it complicates the relationships of syntax and language, meaning and interpretation, and, in the question of its origins, literature and folklore. In spite of a significant body of medieval nonsense in both drama and poetry, most criticism erroneously treats “literary nonsense” as a discrete Victorian phenomenon. Other critical veins emphasize nonsense’s universality—though deeply intertwined with human psychology, the medieval and folkloric nonsense tradition relates to the Victorian much more concretely. This connection has not yet been grounded in literary, academic analysis; I forge this connection this thesis. Overlooking the distinctly literary historical traditions embedded in modern nonsense oversimplifies the genre, inappropriately diminishing the continual literary relevance of medieval nonsense. Using the appearances of nonsense in medieval performance as a contextualizing lens, I elucidate the relationship of medieval nonsense to Victorian, particularly through conserved folkloric motifs and a performance-derived spirit of celebration.

Examining the plays reveals important dissimilarities between these men, their partners, and their relationships, and as the plot and the characters unfold, the couples are driven towards diverse endings.  Claudio, barely punished, gets a happy ending.  Othello, though, is brutally punished.  Finally, Posthumus, also roughly punished, finally understands how to redeem himself and save his marriage.  By rewarding some actions and choices with happy endings and condemning others to sorrow and death, Shakespeare paints a picture about the importance of a certain kind of love and bond in a healthy and strong relationship.",2013,"English,

Now considered antitheses, these two types of thought rarely meet. The poems of Marianne Moore and A.R. Ammons undermine this widely-held opinion by demonstrating how science can function as a means of communication. Without sacrificing the merits and cultural purposes of poetry, both these poets fully integrated scientific vocabulary and concepts into their poems. Despite their shared scientific regard, Moore and Ammons’ works differ greatly. Moore wished to communicate the idea of observable but ineffable principles, and turned to science to compensate for the failings she perceived in language. Her post-modern successor Ammons demonstrated an infallible faith in language, viewing scientific jargon as simply another list of words to be used in the verbal capture of his observed surroundings.

While no one denies that Henry IV is a rich play both critically and theatrically, arguments regarding its protagonist and genre are far more contentious: Hal is the only possible lead, or his father is, the play is just a comedy, or just a tragedy. But in each case, both are, or at least can be, true. So we attempted to maintain the dynamic balance of Shakespeare’s text in performance: rather than choosing one of four major characters to feature in the lead role (either Hal, Henry, Hotspur, or Falstaff) or between genres to elevate (namely drama, comedy, or tragedy), we tried not to choose. If Shakespeare didn’t, then neither would we. That challenge belonged to the audience. ",2013,English,English

Abstract,

 ,
,
What are the limits of the law? Admittedly, without the rule of law we are doomed to live a life that is, in Hobbesian terms, “nasty, brutish and short”. With too much law, however, we risk being encased in what German sociologist Max Weber called the ‘iron cage’ of legal rationality that vitiates democratic engagement and autonomous decision-making. The use of law as a tool to promote moral ideals or enforce moral obligations overlooks the inherent tension, as noted by Max Weber, between formal law and substantive values. In this presentation, I offer arguments against legal paternalism and legal moralism, and advocate for a legal system that, in Isaiah Berlin’s words, “sets the frontiers within which man shall be inviolable”.,

""Intimate labor” refers to forms of labor that maintain precise social relations between a worker and multiple customers. This includes occupations like child care, sex work, and domestic care. Intimate laborers provide services that expose them to sensitive personal information about their clients. Many forms of intimate labor are,
,
highly stigmatized, and my research examines the way in which stigmas attached to intimate labor are mitigated through processes of professionalization. I posit that, via their exposure to many people’s personal information, workers performing unprofessionalized and under-regulated intimate labors become “nodes” of counter-discourse that constitute sites of aggregated counter-discursive knowledge. I argue that unprofessionalized intimate labor’s threat to dominant discourses (e.g. normalizing discourses of sex, childhood, bodily appearance) is neutralized,,
,
in the short term, by the discrediting effects of stigma and, in the long term, by professionalization (and, consequently, absorption into normalizing discourses themselves).,

I will present my research on feminism as it relates to the philosophical concept of essence and the broader intellectual context from which contemporary feminist doctrines have emerged. My focus is on the relationship between essence and freedom, autonomy, and individualism. I argue that feminist philosophy breaks from,
,
traditionalist views of freedom—especially classical liberal views—and instead is derived from a modern post-structuralist viewpoint in which liberation from essence, as opposed to perfection of essence, is a required component of freedom for individuals. In analyzing this aspect of the feminist movement, I will focus on three questions: what “essence” means in the post-structuralist intellectual context;,
,
what it means in feminist doctrine; and the effects of this theoretical “liberation from essence” in political movements and social policy in the real world. I argue that the classical liberal ideal—which lies more in the perfection of essence—might be a worthwhile and more nuanced approach to feminism.",2016,Unspecified,Sociology

However, many vaccine delivery systems have not yet capitalized on our current understanding in the adaptive immune response. Recently identified toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide promising targets for novel vaccine delivery. We hypothesize that nanoparticles engineered to deliver a TLR agonist and antigen in a controlled-release manner to antigen-presenting cells (APC) can stimulate the immune system. The nanoparticle will be endocytosed and degraded by APCs, including dendritic cells (DCs), which will become activated to present the desired antigen on their surface. Nanoparticle size ensures localized delivery of the contents to the secondary lymphoid organs. Polymeric poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol) / poly(lactic acid)-TLR-agonist (PLGA-PEG/PLA-TLR agonist) nanoparticles are attractive for this vaccination system because of their size, biodegradability, biocompatibility, controlled-release, and stability. Our PLGA-PEG/PLA-TLR agonist nanoparticle vaccines have been shown to augment antigen presentation and co-stimulatory DC molecule production for model protein ovalbumin and to mount an antigen-specific CD8+ na•ve cell-proliferation in vitro. In vivo, our vaccines have been shown to increase the antigen-specific adaptive immune response for both the cell-mediated and humoral branches while reducing systemic toxicity, in comparison to soluble adjuvant. Our findings demonstrate the clinical potential for safe, yet effective delivery of novel TLR adjuvants and polymeric nanoparticles towards the development of effective and low-cost vaccines.",2015,Biological Chemistry,Biological Chemistry

Their ascent into stardom was realized through the hard work of talented composers, artists, and choreographers, their founder and impresario Sergei Diaghilev, and their powerful, connected, and intelligent patrons. Recent scholarship has often overlooked the influence and importance of patronesses like the Comtesse Greffulhe, the Princesse de Polignac, Misia Sert, and Coco Chanel and their contributions to the aesthetics of the Ballets Russes. My senior thesis explores the different effects of these four patronesses on the productions of the Ballets Russes.

2561,2014,"Understanding Developmental Timing in the Tobacco Hornworm, Manduca sexta"," Nicole E Hatem, 2014, Biological Sciences",Yuichiro  Suzuki,"Manduca sexta, or the Tobacco Hornworm, goes through five molts before becoming a pupa. After the fifth larval molt, the caterpillar goes from the larval stage (caterpillar) to the pupal stage (pupae). This change is marked by a drop in Juvenile Hormone (JH) in the hemolymph, the caterpillarÕs circulatory liquid analogous to mammalian blood. JH levels drop in the hemolymph once the caterpillar reaches a particular body size. Starvation before reaching the critical weight delays pupation. If JH is removed from the animal, the larva can pupate at a much smaller body size as long as it feeds a diet containing amino acids. Amino acids activate the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway, so we hypothesized that TOR signaling might regulate the timing of pupation in larvae that have no JH. Feeding the caterpillars a rapamycin enriched diet inhibits TOR signaling. In black mutant Manduca sexta that naturally have less JH, feeding rapamycin produced significantly larger animals. In contrast the wild type animals rapamycin depressed the growth rate, but does not change the peak weight. The prothoracic gland growth was also disproportionately slower relative to the growth of the whole body. Further analysis of the prothoracic gland size compared to growth rate will shed light on how closely the prothoracic gland size is tied to the onset of metamorphosis.",2014,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

My research is about the way in which Jamaican immigrants to the United States acquire features of Standard American English. Accents and dialect change are a common phenomenon, but have not been widely researched. Jamaican Creole, or Patwa, presents a unique case for this type of linguistic study because of its close relationship with English and the embedded history of its formation. This research study consists of interviews with Jamaican immigrants, with a wide range of ages, socioeconomic statuses, and length of U.S. residency. Within the interviews, target words and sounds are elicited from the participants and background information is collected in the follow-up questionnaire. This study predicts that the speakers will demonstrate some acquisition of Standard American English accent features, and that this acquisition process will vary with SES and length of residency. Additionally, this study will examine what features are more easily acquired in the process of dialect change. ",2014,Cognitive&Linguistic Sciences,Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences

Findings in the literature indicate that people with negative affect may perform better than people in a positive mood on certain types of cognitive tasks, including memory and stereotype susceptibility.

After the genocide, the Tutsi regime was intent on addressing impunity, but faced steep challenges in light of the scope of the violence. Given the overwhelming caseload facing the conventional courts, the state turned to gacaca, a system of community-based courts based on a traditional conflict resolution model of the same name. However, it made significant modifications to the traditional scheme, including making Rwandans' participation mandatory.This research examines these modifications to the traditional gacaca system and considers the implications of the state's approach for advancing national reconciliation. As scholars have observed, while gacaca in its traditional form advanced reconciliation, the features of the contemporary system created a vastly different setting, which laid the foundations for different results. My research explores some of these results in the context of the stateÕs organization and implementation of the gacaca system. Considering data gathered from my interviews with Rwandans, I will present an analysis of how Rwandans generally have perceived gacaca and its role in advancing national reconciliation.

2580,2014,Bullfighting in Ernest Hemingway's fiction and nonfiction," Stephanie L Gall, 2014, English and Neuroscience",William  Cain," Ernest HemingwayÕs passion for bullfighting began in 1923 when he was 22 years old and continued until his death in 1961.   Throughout his career, he frequently returned to bullfighting in his life and work, generating numerous short stories, a novel and two nonfiction books on the subject.  My research explores HemingwayÕs attraction to bullfighting over time in order to gain a fuller perception of the author as a man and writer.  Hemingway began writing about the bullfight in his journalism, but soon he explored it in his fiction.  For him, especially in his short stories, the bullfight illuminates the tragedy of the bullÕs inevitable death.  But Hemingway also uses the bullfight to comment on the tragic elements of life, such as inescapable solitude and defeat.  In HemingwayÕs final nonfiction work, The Dangerous Summer (1985), he chronicles the rivalry of the matadors Antonio Ord—–ez and Luis Miguel Domingu’n during the summer of 1959.

Conscription, or compulsory enlistment of military service, is a practice that has existed in diverse cultures since ancient times.

Among the few that continue the practice is the Republic of Korea, in a protracted conflict with the Democratic PeopleÕs Republic of Korea, commonly known as South and North Korea respectively. South KoreaÕs geopolitical condition serves as the justification for its focus on the military, and consequently the justification for its tight control over the citizens, both those fulfilling the duty to national defense and those not considered as the duty bearers.,
South Korean military and gender practices were recently made public in early 2013 with ÔReal Manly Man (chinjja sanai)Õ, a military experience reality TV show.

2586,2014,The love-hate relationship between plants and light: Investigations on high light tolerance mechanisms in Arabidopsis thaliana," Andrea J Bae, 2014, Neuroscience",Martina  Koniger,"Light is a taxing environmental challenge to plants. Although it is necessary for photosynthesis, excess light can inflict cellular damage, reduce photosynthetic ability, decrease growth, and strain fitness. Despite their immobility, plants manage to tolerate an impressive range of environmental light conditions through a variety of sophisticated acclimation responses. One mechanism plants utilize to acclimate to fluctuating light conditions is chloroplast movement. Chloroplast movement involves the physical rearrangement of chloroplasts within the cell to either avoid or maximize light absorption. In addition to chloroplast movement, plants rely on non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), also known as heat dissipation, to minimize light-induced damage through the conversion and subsequent dissipation of excess light into heat. In the Kšniger lab, we evaluate the relative importance of these fast acclimation responses toward the plantÕs fitness by studying various Arabidopsis thaliana mutants that exhibit genetic impairments related to chloroplast movement or NPQ. In addition, we investigate how different light conditions during growth affect the degree to which plants rely on these mechanisms. Our current investigations have shown chloroplast movement and NPQ are sensitive to environmental growth conditions during growth. In fact, plants grown under higher light exhibit chloroplast movement to a lesser degree than plants grown under lower light. However, plants grown under higher light exhibit higher NPQ abilities than plants grown under lower light. These findings suggest that a plantÕs chloroplast movement and NPQ mechanisms are flexible to environmental modulation.   Through these studies, we construct a better understanding of the plantÕs impressive physiological capabilities in tolerating its environmental stressors. ",2014,Neuroscience,Biological Sciences
2587,2014, Navigating between the Cultures as Strategic Players: A Sociological Research on Chinese Oversea StudentsÕ Customized Self-Presentation on Facebook and Renren," Xinyue  Wu, 2014, Sociology",Joseph  Swingle,"Cross bridging sociology and game theory, this project aims to investigate how the Chinese oversea college students in the U.S. manage to build different ideal self-images on the two major social networking sites (SNS) by developing strategies accordingly.,
Facebook is the most commonly used global online social networking site where the users can upload pictures, post statuses, add other users as   friendsÓ and play online interactive games. While the Chinese censorship banned Facebook together with Google and Youtube, this political move gave rise to local websites that copied the services of these successful foreign sites. Renren emerged as the   Chinese FacebookÓ in 2005, and quickly developed into Chinese biggest SNS by 2008. Now, Renren incorporates some unique features such as visitor calculation in the usersÕ personal pages, but the overall outlook still resembles that of its precedent, Facebook.,
Prudently processing their pictures with Photoshop software, deliberately posting when most friends are online, and touching on the most recent and sensitive topics in news, people post to be seen, to be heard, and to be noticed. The Chinese oversea students, as well as millions of other SNS users, are trying to get attention from the potential viewers and optimize the resulting self-fulfillment from the attention, consciously and unconsciously. However, to fulfill their social needs among Chinese from their hometown and the newly-acquainted American fellows, the majority of the Chinese oversea students in the U.S. have Facebook and Renren accounts.,
Though Renren is arbitrarily referred to as   the Chinese FacebookÓ, no matter how seemingly minute and deceptively inconsequential the differences between the two SNS may appear, when the trivial differences in web designs meet with the undercurrent of nation cultures, it triggers significantly different patterns of self-presentation among the same users. By observing the strategies in attracting attention on different platforms, it sheds light on the constructed selves: if we make slight changes in the platform where people express themselves, are we going to inspire the users to adapt new strategies to obtain their needs for attention? Do the channeled self-presentations lead to new constructed selves? Or, are we social chameleons, shedding off and putting on identities when needed?,
Hypothesis 1:,
The Chinese and American cultural backgrounds value different postings. The revered Confucian traditions in Chinese society extends its influence into the cyber society: a netizen who shows intellectual depth and opinionate personality usually attracts more followers and fans. However, the American society values more individualism and puts less emphasis on intelligence during interpersonal communications. Consequently, the Chinese oversea students tend to post long blogs touching on popular political, ideological and artistic issues on Renren; on Facebook, they update more personal and emotional short statuses. On either site, they post most desired and valued contents to maximize their self-fulfillment from other viewersÕ attention.,
Hypothesis 2:,
The web designs of Renren and Facebook channel different self-presentation strategies among the users. Though Renren and Facebook are identical on first sight, Renren has a trivial but crucial feature on its personal pages: other than the   likesÓs and comments, the users can check out each otherÕs total number of visitors, the recent 50 visitors, and the threads if someone else shares his/her posts. The popularity on Renren is significantly more visible than Facebook, and this design provokes more self-awareness when posting, since he/she can instantly check the potential viewersÕ reaction and the resulting popularity. On Renren, the user is able to develop a winning strategy of getting attention by the trials and fails of formers posts. The best players are   Renren celebritiesÓ who have millions of visitors,   befriendÓ tens of thousands of followers, and are known for   being knownÓ. These users serve as the interchanges of RenrenÕs clustered social network, amplifying the weak tie---namely, the power of   friendÕs friendsÓ. The centralized networking structure in turn have an impact on the usersÕ behavioral pattern: the Chinese oversea students post political, ideological and artistic contents not only to win attention from their friends but also to impress the unknown audiences---the friendsÕ friends. On the other hand, Facebook promotes more spread-out and enclosed network where people donÕt usually reach out to strangers for attention. Consequently, the Chinese oversea students post more private, personal and emotional posts because their viewers are mostly their friends.,
Hypothesis 3:,
The Chinese oversea students present themselves differently to fulfill their varied social goals on Renren and Facebook. In the hierarchy of Chinese society, the oversea students are usually from the upper class, and this sense of economical priority is implicitly revealed by brandishing the related intellectual priority on Renren. Posting political, ideological academic opinions and essays on a platform of local Chinese users, the Chinese oversea students are demonstrating the underlying economic advantages behind their superior education. For them, the social goal on Renren, is to stand out.,
On the other hand, the Chinese oversea students update their Facebook account to keep in contact with their American friends. By posting pictures with their American friends and sharing Chinese news, they project a self-image of open-minded Chinese who embrace liberty and democracy, a constructed-self expected to win popularity among the American players on the platform.  The social goal of using Facebook, for the Chinese oversea students, is to fit in.,
This project samples the online self-presentation of 40 Chinese oversea college students who have both Renren and Facebook accounts, and have been in the U.S. for at least one year. The researcher collects and codes the literal and figurative postings on their Facebook and Renren personal websites across a three months time span. This research also includes interviews with 15 Chinese oversea students to collect first-hand information on the usersÕ satisfaction and attachment to the two sites. ",2014,Sociology,Sociology
2588,2014,Influences of Late Beethoven Piano Sonatas on SchumannÕs Solo Piano Work: Incorporation of Beethovenian Elements in SchumannÕs Phantasie in C," Michiko O Inouye, 2014, Music",Charles  Fisk,"SchumannÕs Phantasie Op. 17 in C Major was composed in 1836 with the primary intention of raising funds for a monument for Beethoven at Bonn. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that this piece, originally dedicated in BeethovenÕs honor, would draw inspiration from BeethovenÕs distinct compositional style. Although general conclusions have been made regarding SchumannÕs references to BeethovenÕs music in the Phantasie, in particular the quotation of the final song of BeethovenÕs song cycle An die Ferne Geliebte, closer observations of the musical parallels in terms of harmony, rhythm, key-relationships, and textural choices between SchumannÕs Phantasie and specific Beethoven works have yet to be demonstrated. I hope to explore the specific musical characteristics adopted from Beethoven by Schumann in his Phantasie by close comparison of the Phantasie with late Beethoven sonatas, including his Op. 109, 110, and 111. These analyses can aid in identifying the specific characteristics of BeethovenÕs music from which Schumann drew inspiration, as well as in understanding the ways in which he remodeled these elements creatively. In my presentation, I hope to outline the musical parallels found, and demonstrate a few ways in which the pianist can accentuate these parallels in performance of the Phantasie. ",2014,Music,Music

Currently, CS110 uses TextWrangler (a simple text editor that one could compare to Microsoft Word without the formatting) and Fetch (software for copying files between computers). While these tools help students to accomplish tasks in CS110, they have flaws. For example, users are not necessarily aware of specific changes that their partner has made to the code, and also risk overwriting their partnerÕs code when uploading files to a joint hosting account using Fetch. Other tools exist that donÕt have these flaws; however these tools are pitched for professional programmers. Furthermore, there is ample evidence that collaborative work can enhance the educational experience through both deep and meaningful learning allowing for a new level of understanding. CS110 takes advantage of the benefits of collaborative work, however, the current tools do not make it easy for the students.,
,
The goal of CodeSync is to create a collaborative coding environment that is easy-to-use and engaging for beginners, suitable for use in medium-sized projects. My vision is that this environment will allow an individual or a team to create web-based coding projects that others can easily join and contribute to. Hopefully the engaging nature of this software will assist in keeping introductory computer science students excited about collaborating with each other to create amazing projects.,
,
Each user will have her own account and with this account, the user will be able to create projects with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (languages used to develop websites) files, organized into folders. Users will be able to share projects with others and see what their team members type in real-time, much like Google Docs.,
,
CodeSync will generate a project history log so that the project team can see which team members made which changes and when - these logs will each have an informal description, specified by the partner that made the change. ,
Through the introduction of CodeSync, a collaborative coding tool specifically geared toward beginning web development students, students will find collaborative coursework to be easier, more reliable, and more enjoyable.",2014,Computer Science,Computer Science

2593,2014,No action video game training effects for multiple object tracking or mental rotation,"Amyeo A Jereen,  2014,  Neuroscience and Anika M Guha, 2014, Neuroscience",Jeremy  Wilmer,"A large and rapidly growing literature suggests that playing action video games may enhance a range of cognitive capacities (Powers et al, 2013).  This literature, however, has recently been criticized for methodological shortcomings, including inadequate blinding (e.g. Boot et al, 2012).  Two of the most highly cited studies reported successful training of mental rotation (MRT; Feng et al, 2007) and multiple object tracking (MOT; Green & Bavelier, 2006).  The only published attempt to replicate these findings found no training effect (Boot et al, 2012), yet this study did not document sufficient reliability in its MRT and MOT tests to detect a training effect.  We attempt here to replicate the original training effects with highly reliable MRT (alpha=0.82) and MOT (alpha=0.82) tests.  We used the same action video game as the prior studies (Medal of Honor, MOH, a first-person shooter), plus matched action (Wii Sports) and non-action (World of Goo, strategy game) control training games and a no-training control (NTC).  We carefully blinded participants to our hypotheses, and an extensive post-training questionnaire confirmed that this blinding succeeded.  Conditions did not differ significantly in their pre/post difference for either MOT (F(3,76)=0.93, p=0.43) or MRT (F(3,77)=1.96, p=.13), and no active training condition improved significantly more than the NTC on either measure.  Surprisingly, MOH improved numerically (though not significantly) less than all other conditions for both measures.  In sum, our carefully controlled, blinded study failed to replicate two key benefits reported for action video game training, despite highly reliable measures.  It is possible that the original reports of positive training effects for MRT and MOT were due to insufficient blinding or random chance.  Our results suggest that action video game playing has less influence on MRT and MOT than those prior results implied.",2014,Neuroscience,Neuroscience
2594,2014,No action video game training effects for flicker change detection,"Anika M Guha,  2014,  Neuroscience and Amyeo A Jereen, 2014, Neuroscience",Jeremy  Wilmer," The frustrating experience of a good flicker change detection (FCD) task beautifully demonstrates a cognitive capacity more limited than we feel it should be.  Yet some individuals have a far greater capacity to notice such changes than others.  What is the source of these differences, and can cognitive training enhance our FCD ability?  A recent report of superior FCD performance in action video game players raises the possibility that playing such games may improve FCD ability (Clark, Fleck & Mitroff, 2011).  We conducted a randomized, controlled trial (n=81, 12 hours of training) to see if action video game play would enhance FCD ability.  Our game of interest was Medal of Honor (MOH), a first-person shooter used in many prior action video game training studies (e.g. Green & Bavelier, 2003).  Our two control games were World of Goo (WOG, a strategy game) and Wii Sports (WS, a sports game), and we included a no-training control condition (NTC).  To sensitively detect potential training-related improvements, we used a highly reliable FCD task (alpha=0.88). An extensive post-training questionnaire confirmed that participants were blind to our hypothesis.  While all conditions improved significantly (p<0.01), improvement did not differ significantly between conditions (F(3,75)=0.76, p=0.52).  Improvement in the MOH condition was numerically (though not significantly) lower than that of the WOG condition, suggesting no hint of a differential training effect for MOH.  Furthermore, no single training condition improved significantly more than the NTC condition, strong evidence against even a non-specific improvement for all video games.  In sum, action video game playing did not improve FCD ability in our study.  These results, in combination with our prior finding of high heritability of FCD ability (Wilmer et al, 2012), suggest that FCD may be relatively impervious to environmental factors.",2014,Neuroscience,Neuroscience

Although women are often excluded in the popular memory of both the civil rights movement and black comics in the United States, the most financially successful, and arguably influential, black comedian of the 1960s was Jackie ""Moms"" Mabley. She appeared on stage as a bedraggled, grandmother figure that boldly asserted her sexual desires while slyly critiquing segregation, the United States government, and old men. She used her privileged position to directly contribute to the civil rights movement while indirectly uniting diverse populations around her common cultural capital.

2600,2014,"Authenticity in adolescentsÕ relationships:,
The roles of emotion regulation and perceived parental feedback"," Madelaine R Abel, 2014, Psychology",Sally  Theran,"      Researchers have consistently noted that authenticity in relationships is essential to the development of well-being and promotes competence in interpersonal relationships (Harter, Marold, Whitesell, & Cobbs, 1996). Authenticity involves knowing the self and understanding oneÕs own thoughts, feelings, desires, needs, or beliefs (Harter, 2002). The construct of authenticity also applies to an individualÕs behaviors: authenticity implies that one will act in accordance with inner thoughts and emotions. Indeed, expressing the self in ways that are congruent with inner emotions and thoughts (i.e.,   saying how you really feelÓ) is a fundamental component of authenticity. However, few studies to date have explored the factors that may help to account for why some adolescents, and not others, are at risk for problems with authenticity in relationships (with the exception of Theran (2009) and Harter et al., (1996a, 1997)). The objective of my study is to examine the roles that parental support and criticism and emotion regulation strategy play in shaping authenticity in relationships.,
      Emotion regulation is one critical variable to explore as it is theoretically and empirically related to openness and honesty in intimate relationships. Emotion regulation is defined as the ability to monitor oneÕs emotional reactions and use oneÕs interpretation of feeling states to determine subsequent behavior. Effective emotion regulation skills predict good functioning in social relationships in both children and adolescents (Butler, Egloss, Wilhelm, Smith, Erickson, & Gross, 2003; English & John, 2012; Onchwari & Keengwe, 2011). Moreover, difficulties with emotion regulation increase the risk for poor functioning in relationships (English & John, 2012) and for internalizing problems such as anxiety and depression (Suveg & Zeman, 2003). The current study examines the role of emotion regulation in developing authenticity in relationships.,
      In adolescence, individuals become increasingly aware that they are the object of other peopleÕs evaluations and the opinions of others gain significance in defining the self. Adolescents will try to hide their true selves if those behaviors and emotions do not coincide adequately with societal standards or the opinions of other important figures (i.e., peers and parents) (Harter, 2002). Level of support and acceptance therefore is a significant predictor of false-self behavior. An adolescent who perceives minimal support and encouragement from peers and parents will mold his or her behaviors in an attempt to gain support and approval (Deci & Ryan, 1995; Harter, Stocker, & Robinson, 1996). Accordingly, when adolescents perceive support from others, they are more likely to feel comfortable expressing their inner thoughts and emotions, thereby increasing authenticity.,
      AdolescentsÕ emotion regulation processes and perceptions of parental feedback are expected to predict authenticity in relationships with parents. Further, level of parental support is hypothesized to moderate the relation between authenticity and emotion regulation.",2014,Psychology,Psychology

We examined whether future thinking is also influenced by mood in a similar way: Do people imagine more positive or more negative future events depending on their mood? Previous research also suggests that events further in the future are seen more positively than events closer in time. Therefore, we also examined whether imagined future events were further away in time when participants were in a positive mood than when they were in a negative mood. Our findings may provide insight on how we imagine the future as a result of our emotional state of mind. ",2015,Mathematics and Psychology,Psychology

It is a rare jewel of the art song repertoire because of its genre: it is one of the first of few orchestral song cycles ever to be composed, and the only one from nineteenth century France that is well known today. Another fascinating aspect of the work is its unconventional origin: it was initially composed for voice and piano in 1840-1841, and not fully orchestrated until 1856. Despite its late appearance on the scene and its minimal performance hisory during Berlioz's lifetime, without question, the orchestral version has been the work to withstand the test of time: the piano version is less well known and far less admired today. It is BerliozÕs masterful orchestration that sent the initially admired piano version into obscurity and propelled the orchestral version into the limelight in the centuries following BerliozÕs death.

Sherr Student Research internship at the Wellesley Centers for Women, I worked with senior research scientist Dr. Wendy Wagner Robeson on a project looking at English Language Learners (ELLs) in rural Alabama. English Language Learners (ELLs) are students, both U.S.-born and foreign-born, who are learning English and do not understand enough to learn without support in mainstream classrooms. These students are faced with the dual load of learning English and keeping up in their academic classes, which are taught in their new language, putting them at risk of falling behind their peers. ELL students living in rural Alabama face additional challenges when it comes to access to support and resources. With steps being taken from the Alabama State Department of Education to further support ELLs, recent growth in the number of ELLs nationwide, and the continuing growth and diversity of AlabamaÕs population, there is hope for positive change and increased support for ELLs in rural Alabama.

2613,2014,Real and Imaginary Social Relationships: Imagined Interactions and Attachment Styles," Janet W Jeong, 2014, Psychology",Tracy  Gleason,"Imagined interactions (IIs) are a form of intrapersonal communication in which individuals recreate prior social encounters in their minds as well as rehearse for anticipated encounters. For example, before a job interview, you might rehearse your presentation in your head. Individual differences in IIs have emerged in terms of variables such as frequency, variety, and specificity. One factor that might influence the kinds of IIs in which an individual engages is attachment style. Attachment styles describe the quality of peoplesÕ orientation towards relationships with others. My research question investigates whether attachment styles and the various facets of IIs are correlated. I hypothesize that a person who is preoccupied by their relationships with others might engage in a higher frequency of IIs than someone with a secure attachment style. On the other hand, attachment style and specificity of IIs are not expected to relate to one another. The results of this study will provide new insights into the ways in which imagination and mental processes link to real social relationships.",2014,Psychology,Psychology

2623,2014,"The Right to Choose Privacy: An Exploration of the Legal, Social and Cultural Ramifications of Legislating the American Family Ideal in the Post WWII United States"," Katherine E Leung, 2014, Political Science and History",Brenna  Greer,"Following WWII the fervently anti-communist atmosphere in the United States prompted the government, media and business community to promote a consumer culture centered on the idea of the ideal American family Ð most commonly portrayed as  a small, nuclear, middle class white family living in the suburbs. This family consisted of a white heterosexual couple with two to three children, often depicted as future capitalists, living in the suburbs with his and hers cars, a dog, and a white picket fence. This image, which dominated American film, television and advertising throughout the second half of the twentieth century, continues to maintain significant influence over American popular culture with only two of the three major national networks airing primetime programming focused on a family that does not fit this cultural ideal, and without more than one such primetime program on any network. This version of the   American DreamÓ and the family ideal at its core have become iconic representations of   success and happinessÓ to the extent that they continue to shape the values and objectives of young men and womenÑas well as public policyÑin the 21st century, despite very different historical circumstances.,
 ,
In this project, I approach the question of how and why this particular family ideal continues to reign supreme in the public imagination by exploring the relationship between the performance and uses of construction of American familyhood and legal debates surrounding individualsÕ rights in terms of family planning. The rhetoric and tactics that particular groups used in legal battles over rights to privacy and birth control, in particular, suggest that the iconic American family not only propped up U.S. consumer culture, but also provided the ideological ground upon which the white-middle class pursued their rights to be a small nuclear family in manners that deprived other groups of the same privileges and ultimately shored up white patriarchy.,
Since the 1950Õs, women have played an integral role in the demolition of laws restricting privacy and legislating the American family ideal, yet little has been written about the significance of the historical and cultural constructs of race, gender and family in these cases. While much has been written on the racialization of the American family ideal, my research combines a legal history of the right to privacy itself, with the cultural and social constructs that both promoted and helped destroy these laws by demonstrating a history and tradition of the right to privacy in personal relationships and reproductive decisions that helped establish the right to privacy as a fundamental right, which was therefore subject to strict scrutiny in the eyes of the Supreme Court. This heightened level of scrutiny which can only be applied in cases where a fundamental right is threatened was crucial to overturning these laws, and in order to demonstrate the history and tradition of the right to privacy in these decisions, women had to explore the tradition of the American family ideal, which was not historically legally restricted to intra-racial marriage or strictly unprotected sexual relations between man and wife because historically such legal constructs were not necessary to enforce this American family ideal. Through this demonstration many of the women involved in these landmark cases like Griswold and Roe had to perpetuate the social construct that the American family ideal was deeply engrained in history and tradition and that the freedom to choose that ideal, by marrying the person with whom you were engaged in a sexual relationship, or by choosing only to have two children so that you might live in the suburbs and perpetuate the Leave it to Beaver image was a fundamental right. My research seeks to demonstrate the intersection between the social and cultural histories of the American family ideal and the legal history of the right to privacy.,

In insects, the timing of metamorphosis is regulated by the interaction between juvenile hormone (JH) and ecdysteroids. My research focuses on how the POU transcription factor Ventral vein lacking (Vvl) plays an important role in regulating the onset of metamorphosis. Silencing Vvl expression using RNAi interference (RNAi) resulted in the induction of precocious metamorphosis in Tribolium castaneum and a reduction in the expression of the JH-inducible gene kruppel homolog 1 (kr-h1). In addition to inducing precocious metamorphosis, molting was also inhibited in vvl RNAi animals. Since molting is regulated by ecdysteroids, the activity of ecdysteroid signaling pathway was examined in vvl knockdown animals. Thus, I looked at how vvl influences both JH and ecdysone signaling and biosynthesis, potentially acting as an integrator of both hormonal pathways to regulate the metamorphic onset.",2014,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

Here, we investigate the response of the coast since 2004 through field surveys, spatial imagery analysis, and numerical modeling. Three automatic level surveys were conducted in 2009, 2012, and 2013 over a beach ridge plain 15 km north of the city of Meulaboh and just south of the Woyla River. The surveys followed a transect from the coast up to 1.8 km inland. An 18.8 km long stretch of the same coastline was analyzed by digitizing the shoreline on satellite and aerial images taken between 2002 and 2011 and by computing the shoreline change rates using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) developed by the US Geological Survey. Following the initial erosion of an average 134 m during the December 26, 2004 event, the coast prograded at a rate of 15.8 m/yr with an average gain of 55 m from 2005 to 2006. This re-growth slowed to 6.8 m/yr from 2006 to 2009 and 1.2 m/yr from 2009 to 2011. Even though a wide new beach ridge has formed since 2004, the coastline never fully recovered to its pre-2004 position. In 2011 it was still an average of 52.7 m from its initial position in 2002. The three topographic surveys show that the top of the newly formed beach ridge stands out 80 cm higher than older beach ridges further inland, probably a response to the higher relative sea level induced by co-seismic subsidence in 2004. While satellite images indicate coastal progradation until April 2011, most recent topographic surveys conducted in 2012 and 2013 show a renewed retreat of the coastline of up to 40 m. In order to understand the most recent retreat and the complex interaction of vertical ground movement, sediment supply, and hydrodynamic parameters, we will apply the coastal model UNIBEST-TC developed by Deltares to the Aceh coastal system. Such data will provide insight into the mechanisms that lead to beach ridge formation and the modifications of coastal morphologies by earthquakes and tsunamis.",2014,Geosciences,Geosciences

For singers, there are multiple options, including a cappella groups, the choir, Collegium Musicum, Chamber Singers, individual voice lessons. Unfortunately, there are many who love to sing in groups but may not yet have the musical ability to qualify for any of the existing groups inside and outside of the Music Department. During my experience in the choir, I have noticed that many of the people who are not invited to join the first time they audition eventually sign up for something completely different, and then do not sing while they are a student at Wellesley. To address this issue, I created a non-auditioned training choir open to all Wellesley students. This choir, the Wellesley Preparatory Chorus has three goals:,
,
Provide a choir opportunity for those who would not otherwise have that opportunity, due to lacking musical ability or scheduling conflicts with other singing groups.,
Teach basic vocal technique, sight-reading, and ear training to prepare members to sing with more advanced groups on campus, particularly the Wellesley College Choir.,
Serve the Greater Boston community and foster the community within our group through performances at local nursing homes, hospitals, etc. ,

These behavioral effects of E and P are mediated through their steroid receptors, estrogen receptors (ER) and progestin receptors (PR) respectively. Once bound to hormone, these steroid receptors act in the brain to induce the expression of certain genes. E induces the expression of PR in the brain, thereby making the brain more sensitive to the effects of P. There are two major forms of PR that are made from the same gene, the full-length PR-B and the shorter PR-A. Interestingly, these two receptor isoforms have been found to function differently in the reproductive physiology and behavior of rodents. What is unknown is how E induces one form of PR over the other. Two steroid receptor coactivators (SRCs), SRC-1 and SRC-2, are known to facilitate the induction of PR by estradiol. We predict that the differential recruiting of SRC-1 and SRC-2 in the E induced expression of PR will influence whether PR-A or PR-B is expressed in a cell in the brain. To test this hypothesis we used triple label immunohistochemistry in mice that were genetically engineered to express either PR-A or PR-B. Furthermore, we investigated if SRC-1 and SRC-2 interact differently with the two PR forms. We used pull-down assays to look for interactions with SRC-1 and SRC-2 that are naturally found in the mouse brain. Our goal is to characterize the interactions with different PR isoforms and show their dependence on the activation of PR by binding of hormone. Our results will allow us to further understand the mechanism of steroid receptor mediated gene expression in the brain.,

We hypothesized that children who demonstrated prosocial behaviors, such as helping pick up dropped paper clips, would use more socio-emotional words in their responses to questions than children who did not help, while controlling for general language ability. Participants were 34 preschoolers, ages 3-5-years old (18 boys, 14 girls, Mage = 50.41 months, SD = 6.20 months). Prosocial behavior was measured in terms of the childÕs demonstration of helping behavior by picking up spilled paper clips; the children who did not pick up the paper clips were considered non-helpers. Results from univariate analysis of variance and t-tests showed no significant difference between the socio-emotional language use of helpers versus non-helpers. Although no significant results were found to support our hypothesis, we did find that over half of all the children demonstrated helping behavior. In this way prosocial behavior might still be related to language, however; the relationship is more complex and requires further study. ,

Incidents I will discuss in addition to Katy Perry include Lady Gaga and   Burqa SwagÓ, Miley Cyrus twerking and her use of Black women as accessories, and Selena Gomez (who is Latina, but is often read as white) who put on a Bindi and performed a Bollywood-like dance at an awards show.  Even Lily Allen who is seen as an outspoken artist in the music industry missed the mark in her   Hard Out HereÓ music video when she hypersexualized her Black back-up dancers in a way that was not done to her white dancers.,

2639,2014,Two-choice extinction: A behavioral assay for cognitive flexibility in the mouse model of Fragile X," Madison D Taylor, 2014, Neuroscience",Virginia  Quinan,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading known cause of Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. Fragile X syndrome is a single gene disorder that is caused by the loss of an mRNA-binding protein (FMRP) that is a known repressor of local mRNA translation. Because there is a lack of regulation on the translational process, there is increased protein synthesis at synapses, which is thought to account for many behavioral phenotypes in Fragile X. The mGluR theory of Fragile X suggests that increased protein synthesis can be alleviated by inhibiting group 1-metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) positively coupled to translation, including mGluR5. We have designed a novel behavioral assay in Fmr1 KO mice to test whether indirect pharmacological down-regulation of mGluR5-mediated signaling is sufficient to correct this phenotype by measuring cognitive flexibility. We are studying the cognitive flexibility of these cross-mice in order to determine if the loss of FMRP can be corrected by targeting the mGluR5 pathway. We are particularly interested in extinction (of a learned behavior) because there are noted problems with cognitive flexibility in Fmr1 KO mice and we believe that extinction is a viable measure of cognitive flexibility.

Examining Price Discrimination in Shanghai's Clothing Markets"," Berit  Paxson-Tarnai, 2015, Mathematics",Jianfeng  Zhu,"I first encountered the phenomenon of price discrimination in China while eating with friends at a small Guangdong-style restaurant in Shanghai. While ordering, we, all American college students studying abroad, realized we were being charged higher prices than the locals seated around us. This and other encounters with price discrimination during my six months studying abroad in China sparked my interest in finding out the true cause and extent of this socioeconomic phenomenon in China.,
I designed an experiment and implemented it at two of Shanghai's large clothing bazaars. I hypothesized that no matter the Chinese-speaking ability of a foreign customer, this customer would always be more likely to be charged a higher price for the same goods as a local would. In my experiment, my native Chinese roommate and I haggled separately for the same items, and noted discrepancies in the prices we each received. During some of the trials I pretended not to be able to speak any Chinese, and during others I used my Chinese-speaking ability to its fullest extent (500 level). Repeating this procedure many times provided 50 trials of data. The results were surprising.,
In the end, my appearance as a foreigner had far less impact on price discrimination than did my Chinese-speaking ability. Indeed, when I pretended that I could not speak any Chinese, I was far more likely to be charged a higher price than my roommate. However, when I could speak Chinese, I was very likely to be given, not only the same price, but often a better price than my roommate.,
In my conclusion, I explore a possible explanation for this unexpected result: I believe it can be best explained by the desire for guanxi (good relations), the most important aspect of familial and social relationships in Chinese culture. When Chinese shopkeepers encounter a foreign customer who can speak some Chinese, a foreigner who has thus clearly spent time, money, and effort toward understanding their language and culture, these shopkeepers will desire to create good relations, guanxi, with this person.",2015,Mathematics,Sociology

Understanding the brain is among the largest and greatest frontiers left to tackle. Despite numerous advances in the field and current technology we still have much to learn. Our research attempts to gain a better understanding of the neural origins and correlates of attention. Using a rat model, we recorded the electrical activity from groups of neurons (LFPs) found in the frontal and parietal cortices while the rats are performing an auditory detection task. By comparing trials where the rat has either behaved correctly or incorrectly we can begin to attribute certain neural characteristics to attentional states. Event related potentials were generated from the LFP data. ERPs generally have characteristic peaks at various latencies. The parietal ERP had a positive peak around 200 ms (P2) which had an amplitude of  ~50uV during hit trials, showing a trend toward being larger than the P2 peak during miss trials. This was due to more than just licking since the P2 amplitude was only ~20uV during false alarm trials, which also involve licking. Thus, the parietal P2 is a potential neural correlate for response production. Coherence analysis was also conducted to determine to what degree neural signals are in sync, which indicates the areas of the brain that are communicating or working with each other. Data collection is still underway, but our preliminary results suggest that greater coherence at low frequencies is associated with the act of licking and not necessarily responding correctly. Overall, these results help us to better understand attentional processing in the rat, as well as its correspondence to human attentional processing.,
Technical: ,
In order to investigate the neural basis of response production and response inhibition, rats were trained to lick in response to target tones to receive a water reward, and to refrain from producing a motor response on distractor tones (an auditory Go/No-Go task). Event related potentials (ERPs) were recorded from the medio-dorsal frontal and posterior parietal cortices, and frontal-parietal coherence was calculated for each trial. The parietal P2 peak had an amplitude of ~50uV during hit trials, showing a trend toward being larger compared to the P2 peak during miss trials (~30uV). This was due to more than just the motor response since the parietal P2 amplitude was only ~20uV during false alarm trials, which also involve licking. No differences were found between ERPs during correction rejections and false alarms. This does not support previous human studies, which found the frontal N2 to be related to response inhibition (Pfefferbaum, Ford et al., 1985, Bruin and Wijers, 2002). High levels of delta (0.5-3 Hz) and theta (4-7 Hz) coherence between frontal and parietal were seen in both Go and No-Go trials. Coherence data collection is still underway, but our preliminary results suggest that greater coherence at low frequencies is associated with the act of licking and not necessarily correctly responding.

One type of experimental dark matter detection focuses on directional detection.  The direction of incoming dark matter is modulated both with the Earth's rotation and its orbit around the sun.  In the laboratory, we can detect WIMPs through their interactions with a target gas.  As WIMPs enter a detector, a small number of them will scatter off of target nuclei, causing the nuclei to travel through the gas.

One possibility is that children are motivated to help others in order to preserve their moral identity. In collaboration with Dr. Rebecca Saxe and Dr. Laura Schulz at MIT, I have investigated how moral outcome affects future prosocial behavior. In the study, children were asked to perform an action, after which either a good, bad, or neutral outcome was revealed. We analyzed how the goodness or badness of the event played a role in 1) explanation of the event, and 2) immediate sharing behavior. Preliminary results suggest that children who experienced a bad outcome were more likely to attribute the outcome to the experimenter and share more than kids who performed good or neutral actions. These findings suggest that children are motivated to redeem themselves through subsequent prosocial behavior.,

Blockly, developed by Google's Neil Fraser, is ""a web-based, graphical programming editor. Users can drag blocks together to build an application. No typing required"" (Blockly website). It is also the framework used for the Blocks Editor in MIT's App Inventor 2. ,
During the summer, I worked to create different connector shapes for the jigsaw-puzzle-like blocks. By creating different connector shapes for the different kinds of blocks, users will have even more visual cues to help them code or learn to code. ,
Another project that I worked on is creating an entirely new block shape for MIT App Inventor 2. There were originally 2 types of block shapes: Value Input Shape and Statement Input Shape. A Value Input Shape allowed users to connect blocks on the left and right sides of the block and build blocks horizontally. A Statement Input Shape allowed users to connect blocks on the top and bottom edge and build blocks vertically as well as showing the scope of local variables. The problem arises when, in a function, a user would want to return a value rather than execute a statement. Because of the left/right edge connection of the Value Input Shape, there is a lot of wasted space and there is no visual way to see local variable scope. To solve this, I created an Indented Value Input Shape, which shows scope and saves space.,
This semester, I've been working on adding zoom and scaling the Blocks Editor space in MIT App Inventor 2. Because of the large block shapes and the small space users have to work with in the Blocks Editor, a zoom and scaling function was very necessary.

I'm focusing specifically on attacks made by the poet Catullus and the orator Cicero. My research primarily looks at the mouth becoming impure through oral sex.  More specifically, a man's mouth would be considered impure if he performs oral sex on a man or woman.  The implication that a man has performed oral sex on another man means that the man is the passive sexual partner and is not truly a Roman man.  The nature of the attacks varies between the two due to the different genres in which they wrote.  Catullus's poetry is notable for the use of violent, obscene language.  He either threatens to force his victim to perform oral sex on him to assert his masculinity over the victim or accuses them of performing oral sex in excess.  Cicero, on the other hand, cannot use the same obscene, explicit language in oration.  He instead could only imply the illicit actions or refer to them in a roundabout manner.  I hope to focus this on what the os impurum means for Roman masculinity and how pervasive the attack was given the widespread use in both oration and poetry.

Insects that undergo complete metamorphosis typically undergo three morphologically distinct phases: the larval, the pupa, and the adult stages. Recent studies show that this transition is known to be mediated by a key hormone called juvenile hormone (JH). Yet, how the specific genetic and hormonal components regulate maintenance and regeneration of larval structures, and the transition from the larval to the adult morphology remain poorly understood. Using the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, we examined the role of the Hedgehog (Hh)ligand protein and it's receptor, Patched (Ptc).  The downregulation of Hh resulted in disrupted limb patterning during metamorphosis and inhibition of larval limb regeneration. In contrast, the absence of Ptc led to over-proliferation of cells and ectopic outgrowths in larval limbs. Thus, during larval phase, Hh signaling is actively suppressed by Ptc but becomes activated during metamorphosis, indicating a potential interaction between Hh signaling and JH. In addition, given that Sonic hedgehog is also necessary for vertebrate regeneration, our results suggest a possible conserved role for Hh signaling during regeneration across metazoans.",2014,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

CALCOFI-the California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations program-is virtually unique in using fish larvae surveys to follow trends in regional fish communities. There is need to monitor fish communities elsewhere, but the expense of large sampling programs like CALCOFI and the concern that reduced sampling programs may not be able to capture the same trends in abundance as large programs due to the patchy distribution of fish larvae has prevented their establishment. Using principal component analysis, I evaluated the potential of smaller sampling programs to capture the dominant trends in the annual mean abundance of key fish species and multivariate (community) trends in abundance by analyzing transects and time series of varying length.,

Focusing on sites devoted to the Virgin Mary, my research has lead me to explore how Lourdes, Guadalupe, and Nagasaki allow pilgrims to transform their suffering - not only at the personal level, but also the communal and institutional level. The construction and establishment of Marian pilgrimage sites offer religious practitioners control in their own lives, allow us to reconsider how the body and the earthly world play a role in the religious, and enable us to re-examine the draw of the Compassionate Mother. I argue that these sites and their construction are radical, subversive, and above all liberating.",2015,Religion,Religion

My thesis analyzes this shift in women’s incarceration through the lens of neoliberal governmentality. I argue that incarceration serves not as a means of penance for a specific transgression, but as a vehicle for a gendered reeducation of desire designed to bring justice-involved women into line with normative roles. I draw from government documents addressing women’s incarceration in different states to demonstrate the extent to which neoliberal values and market principles have been incorporated into justice and punishment for women. Additionally, I critically examine the statistical tools used to classify justice-involved women and predict recidivism to highlight the disparities in the level of risk ascribed to different groups of justice-involved women, and how these disparities relate to women’s conformity to neoliberal norms.",2015,"Political Science,

A Look Into American Trade Policy ,"Michelle D Ahn, Internatnl Relations-Pols Sci '15"," David Lindauer, Economics","Since its conception in 1916, the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) has enacted multiple tariffs against unfair trade practices, including the “dumping” of foreign goods in US markets. The ITC claims to administer US trade laws in a fair and objective manner, provide independent analysis, and preserve American interests through remedial trade laws. In our three case studies - Chinese crawfish tail meat (1997), persulfates from China (!997), and certain South Korean large residential washers (2013) - we examine case background, methodology, and even politics to determine whether the tariffs have helped mitigate unfair trade. Economic analysis and research ranging from government documents to direct exchanges with people involved lead us to a unanimous determination.

(Mother colonizer, mother colonized): Writing the mother in three autobiographical novels of Marguerite Duras","Anne S Ratnoff, Cognitive&Linguistic Sciences, French '15"," Catherine Masson, French","My thesis explores the mother-daughter relationship in three novels by French author Marguerite Duras. These works, the “Sea Wall Cycle,” are variations of a story about a young French girl in Indochina and her affair with an older, wealthy Chinese man. The girl’s mother, obsessed with becoming rich in the colonies, is financially ruined by the purchase of a farm that can’t be cultivated. Ironically, the mother becomes colonized herself, subject to the cruel waves of the ocean that drown her crops. She devolves into madness and violence, especially against her daughter, who is a representation of the author’s younger self. Before writing these novels, Duras­ –under her real name Donnadieu– co-authored L’Empire Français, propaganda commissioned by the French government to promote the exploitation of the French Colonies. Therefore, a post-colonial perspective enlightens a psychoanalytical analysis of the mother-daughter relationship and the blending of truth and literature into auto-fiction.",2015,"Cognitive&Linguistic Sciences,

The Notch protein consists of an extracellular domain containing the ligand binding domain and the negative regulatory region (NRR), and an intracellular domain. Our research focuses on point mutations in the NRR’s Heterodimerization (HD) region that are associated with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias/lymphomas (T-ALL). Previous work showed that two T-ALL-associated Leu to Pro mutations in the HD region’s core had different effects on stability and secondary structure of the NRR. Our work examines two unique T-ALL-associated mutations, L1569H and L1663T. While L1569H and the previously studied mutations are in the hydrophobic core, L1663T is on the interface of the HD and the LIN-12 Repeats that comprise the NRR.

Habitat destruction and single-crop agriculture limit the richness of pollen, the primary source of protein, vitamins, and minerals for bees.  Adult bees consume pollen to produce food for their young, but larvae become undernourished during periods of pollen limitation. To determine the effects of larval undernourishment on adult behavior, we divided colonies so that they produced either pollen-limited or abundantly supplied young. When focal larvae became adults, they were weighed, individually tagged, and introduced into a single colony, where we monitored their foraging behavior.  Compared to control bees, we expect adults from pollen-stressed colonies to perform poorly during foraging, recruitment, and as they orient to their homes. Such underperforming bees would likely exacerbate the cycle of nutritional stress experienced by colonies as they forage in their habitat. ",2017,Unspecified,Biological Sciences

Understanding the physical and chemical principles governing specificity and promiscuity in protein—protein binding is important both for understanding mechanisms of molecular recognition and for designing novel biomolecular systems. We use computational techniques to identify the frequencies of occurrence of structural moieties (e.g., side chains and backbones of individual residues) and differences in their energetic contributions within promiscuous and specific protein—protein interactions. To achieve this goal, we are testing multiple hypotheses; for example, we hypothesize that specific proteins, which selectively bind to only one partner, preferentially utilize side chains to mediate binding when compared to promiscuous proteins, which may utilize the structurally consistent backbone moieties more preferentially. Two sets of protein complexes, identified by the literature to be either promiscuous or specific, are being analyzed to test our hypotheses. Preliminary results suggest statistically significant differences between the contributions of certain structural moieties between the two sets. ",2015,Indiv-Chemical Physics,Chemistry

2734,2015,Longitudinal Trends in Children with Severe Early Onset Childhood Obesity,"Adrianne E Lage, Classical Civilization, Spanish '16"," Adam Matthews, Biological Sciences","The prevalence of severe childhood obesity continues to increase at a time when obesity is an epidemic amongst the general population. In this study we will use empirical data to analyze the correlation of the mathematical model of the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) Body Mass Index (BMI) charts with the trend of children with severe early onset obesity. We found that the longitudinal trends in BMI show a faster velocity than the trends predicted by the CDC growth curves. It is possible that these differences of velocities for BMI trends indicate a possible genetic predisposition for obesity. These findings suggest a strong genetic component to severe early onset obesity. Therefore, we propose the development of a new application utilizing a multi-point scoring system that would allow physicians to determine a patient’s qualification for genetic testing to determine the genetic basis of severe early onset obesity.",2016,"Classical Civilization,

The rise of multiply drug-resistant TB has led to a pressing need for new treatments to help contain the infection. Recently, a significant,
amount of research in drug design and discovery has focused on the chalcone and pyrazoline families of compounds, both of which have demonstrated strong potential as antitubercular agents. A classical synthesis of a pyrazoline occurs in two steps: 1) a base-catalyzed aldol condensation between an aromatic ketone and an aldehyde to form a chalcone; 2) cyclization of the chalcone with a hydrazine to prepare the pyrazoline. Here, the laboratory preparation and biological testing of several novel chalcone and pyrazoline derivatives is described.

2737,2015,The Role of Copper in the Oxidative Stress Response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to heat shock ,"Michelle R Brann, Chemistry '15"," Adele Wolfson, Chemistry","In response to stress, cells produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause molecular damage in the form of DNA breaks and modification of lipids and proteins. ROS are also important in cell signaling to induce differential gene expression, metabolic changes and, thus, adaptation to environmental conditions. I hypothesize that ROS response is a common denominator of different environmental challenges, including radiation and microgravity, during spaceflight. Algae, such as the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, grown in spaceflight are exposed to stress. The goal is to characterize the response of C. reinhardtii to stress by examining biochemical and gene expression changes using heat shock. The heat shocked (42°C) C. reinhardtii exhibited a selective regulation of ion transporters and an increase in ROS. Such results provide new insights about the cellular response to stress and its possible mediation during long-term environmental pressure (including spaceflight), and provide a basis for understanding multicellularity evolution.  ",2015,Chemistry,Chemistry
2738,2015,From Birds to Nanoparticles: MR Studies at Wellesley,"Alexandra M Dunn, Chemistry '15"," Nancy Kolodny, Faculty emerita","Functional MRI in Exploration of Songbird Learning and Memory (Stela Petkova),
Songbirds, like zebra finches (Taeniopgia guttata), are an excellent model for human language acquisition, and for studying mechanisms underlying learning and memory. Songbirds share many developmental and anatomical traits with humans, such as similar process of vocal acquisition and analogous auditory processing regions. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be used a noninvasive technique to collect real-time, whole-brain data. In this project, fMRI is used to investigate brain activation due to an auditory stimulus such as familiar or unfamiliar song. This data shows relatively high regional specificity and high temporal specificity. Because fMRI is noninvasive, we are able to introduce multiple stimuli and observe brain activation at various time points in one bird’s life. Our current work is centered on validating the auditory delivery of natural sounding stimuli and statistical analytical methods. We aim to develop these methods in order to acquire high-quality neuronal data.,

Exploring Silica-coated Iron Oxide Nanoparticles as A Drug Delivery System for Pancreatic Cancer (Alice Liao and Susan Haney),
Due to their small size, nanoparticles (NPs) are a suitable platform for building the next-generation targeted therapy for cancer. The high surface-to-volume ratio and well-studied surface chemistry of NPs allow for efficient loading of treatment and targeting moieties. This maximizes drug delivery and ensures high tumor specificity, while sparing healthy tissue. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) NPs, a type of magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agent, combine the small size of nanomaterials with the benefits of MR imaging to provide a non-invasive method for tracking NPs inside the human body. Coating the nanoparticles with silica and polyethylene glycol (PEG) improves their biocompatibility and stability. Previous efforts successfully synthesized silica-coated SPIO NPs with a diameter of approximately 50 nm and a shell thickness of 10-20 nm. Current studies focus on exploring how coatings affect the magnetic properties of the NPs, with the goal of optimizing their performance as MRI contrast agents. Bioimaging methods are being optimized to quantify cellular particle uptake after the addition of a cancer-targeting moiety, a monoclonal antibody, to the particle surface.,

Assessment of a Mouse Model for Schizophrenia (Alexandra Dunn, Tamara Biary, and Dana Williams),
The World Health Organization (2013) describes schizophrenia (SZ) as a chronic brain disorder that affects 24 million people worldwide, only about half of whom receive treatment. SZ is characterized by positive symptoms such as hallucinations, and negative symptoms such as memory, cognitive, and social deficits. Existing SZ medications only adequately address positive symptoms. Consequently, the development of new mouse models from which novel medication can be created is an important research field. Schizophrenia’s specific cause remains unknown, but it is widely accepted that genetic and epigenetic causes are at play. To address these causes we use mice bred with a mutation that knocks out a gene (GCPII) responsible for producing the neurotransmitter glutamate, which is found in altered levels in humans with SZ. We aggravate the model further by introducing a virus to neonatal mice that affects gene expression, simulating epigenetic dysregulation. We analyze the effects of the model on mouse brain anatomy and function using three magnetic resonance (MR) techniques: MR imaging, looking at brain anatomy, MR spectroscopy, assessing levels of brain chemicals, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), analyzing brain region connectivity and white matter structure; these data are collected once a week between postnatal days (PND) 28 and 64. Social withdrawal is investigated using a behavior paradigm between PND 114 and 117.

At Wellesley College, the cogeneration (Cogen) power plant produces energy such as electricity, hot water, and air conditioning for the campus. Built in 1994, the Wellesley power plant was considered a technological marvel, primarily using natural gas which is cleaner and releases fewer greenhouse gas emissions than other fossil fuels. Now, over two decades later, the power plant has become obsolete and replacements are no longer being manufactured. Not only does this pose major uncertainties about the reliability of the plant in the future but there are also environmental, social, and economic factors to consider. With this in mind, the ES300 team will present their findings on Wellesley’s current power plant situation, and propose recommendations and goals for practical practices and technologies to improve efficiency.

Predissociation is a specific type of dissociation caused by discrete, instead of continuous, bands of wavelengths. Because different isotopes will interact with bands of slightly different wavelengths, predissociation can lead to mass-independent isotope fractionation effects, which are an important marker of the history of both extraterrestrial objects and our own planet.

As such, water quality is a serious public health concern worldwide. Due to their low cost and easy accessibility, common household materials such asbleach and vinegar, have been used for water decontamination for decades.  However, there are only a very small number of systematic and quantitative studies on the efficacy of these methods as well as their impact on the biochemical profile of the pathogens.  Escherichia coli (E.coli) is commonly used as an indicator of bacterial contamination due to its prevalence and high mortality rate. In this study, we examined the effects of low pH established by varying concentrations of different acid treatments on E.coli viability and protein expression profiles. A combination of standard culture plating assays and spectroscopic measurements were used to assess viability and determine the minimal acid concentration needed to keep bacterial levels below the EPA’s safe drinking water limits. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization (MALDI) Biotyper was used to analyze changes in the unique protein fingerprint of E.coli harvested at different time points after being subjected to multiple rounds of acid treatment. This work represents the initial step in identifying the E.coli proteins whose expression is altered in response to acid stress.  This information would be important in determining if acid stress results in bacterial resistance and if so, help to developing strategies to overcome it.,

Chromatography columns were used as a laboratory-scale model for the slow sand filters that are found in drinking water plants. If the addition of sorbents like activated carbon to sand filters is effective at removing some pharmaceuticals and personal care products, some treatment plants may be able to avoid high cost processes including membrane filtration and advanced oxidation. ",2017,Unspecified,Environmental Studies

The enzyme thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) has the potential to break down and thus attenuate the effects of GnRH and other peptide growth factors. TOP plays an important regulatory role in steroid hormone production, and may have implications for treatment of prostate cancer. In order to analyze the effects of TOP in the cell proliferation process, androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells were treated with dihydrotestosterone or GnRH. TOP activity was measured with a quenched fluorescence assay and TOP localization was determined by confocal fluorescence imaging. Quantification of TOP levels was obtained via immunoblot. Results demonstrate an increase in TOP levels and activity after treatment with GnRH. This tentatively suggests that GnRH exerts negative feedback on its own activity.",2015,"Italian Studies,

Some factors, such as mimicry, are less obvious. People like people who imitate them better than people who do not. Although mimicry often goes unnoticed by people interacting socially, acts of imitation lead to reports of increased likeability. Interestingly, infants make similar judgments when choosing social partners. Infants have a preference for someone who speaks the same language, shares a food preference, or sings a song previously sung by a parent.

2801,2015,The Growth in the VA's Disability Compensation Program: The Role of Health,"Isabella J Dougherty, Economics, Chinese Language & Culture '15"," Courtney Coile, Economics","The VA’s Disability Compensation (VADC) program, which provides cash benefits for qualifying disabled veterans, has been growing rapidly since 2001. The drivers of the program’s growth are not well understood with worsening health as one possible driver, but recent liberalizations of medical eligibility criteria may also play a role. This study deconstructs the recent growth in the VADC program into the share due to worsening veteran health and the share due to other factors. I use NHIS data to estimate the relationship between health and receipt of VADC benefits in the late 1990s, and then use those estimates with the actual health of recent veterans to project the share of today's veterans that would be on the program if eligibility criteria had not changed. Findings may help policy makers as they consider how to balance the needs of wounded veterans against rapidly rising program expenditures.,

Native children are far more likely than their non-Native peers to grow up in poverty, to suffer from severe health problems, and to face obstacles to educational opportunity. The United States shares a unique trust responsibility with Indian tribes built upon treaties. Because of this relationship, the Obama administration is working to find solutions to pressing education problems confronting Native Youth. This presentation takes viewers through several historical cases, successful and unsuccessful, outlining how educational opportunities have been given to Native youth through federal government intervention.

This modernization and economic growth took place steadily over the course of 300 years, arguably, but in East Asia, particularly in Japan, that growth took about 100 years. This accelerated growth happened not just because of government industrial policy and the push to modernize, but due to companies with private-sector industrial policies and long-term business strategies that suggested a broader industrial development. This can be seen in companies like Mitsui Bussan, whose focus on long-term growth and development meant having industrial policies that not only helped the company but also the still-developing Japanese economy.",2015,"History,

2809,2015,The role of PATELLIN1 and PATELLIN2 in Arabidopsis thaliana vascular development,"Christina E Lepore, Biological Chemistry '17"," T. Kaye Peterman, Biological Sciences","Early during development of the plant vascular system, auxin is channeled into narrow, directional pathways due to polar localization of the auxin efflux protein, PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1). An intracellular membrane trafficking process, involving the vascular proteins SFC, VAB1, CVP2, and CVL1, maintains PIN1 localization. Evidence suggests that the Sec14-related proteins, PATELLIN1 and PATELLIN2 (PATL1/2), are involved in vascular development and may play a role in maintaining PIN polarity. To determine whether PATL1/2 influence PIN1 cycling by interacting with the above-mentioned vascular proteins, mutant strains of Arabidopsis thaliana were crossed to produce either double or triple mutant F2 progeny. We determined the PCR conditions for genotyping several vascular mutant alleles. Homozygous recessive double or triple mutant plants that segregate in the F2 generation will be evaluated by their phenotype. If PATL1/2 function in PIN1 polar localization, we expect to observe more severe vascular defects in the double and triple mutants than in the single mutants.",2017,Biological Chemistry,Biological Sciences

Past research has shown that lower benefits decrease independent living and homeownership, and increase poverty amongst the elderly. However, we know little about how levels of Social Security benefits influence elderly migration and location choice – which may have important implications for the welfare of the elderly, especially if it affects their proximity to their children. With metropolitan housing costs soaring, would lower levels of Social Security benefits force retirees to move from high-cost to low-cost locations? A simple comparison of retirees with higher versus lower benefit levels is problematic since the two groups systematically differ in many ways. I shed light on this question by exploiting the natural experiment of the Social Security “notch” to examine the effects of an exogenous change in Social Security benefits on where the elderly live.",2015,"Economics,

Among the different aspects studied are the environmental impacts on the water quality of the local river, a once commonly used water-source for the community, and the impacts on the air quality. In order to test the water quality of the river, three different sites were chosen for macroinvertebrate collection. Macroinvertebrates are among the best indicators of water quality due to their ability to sustain life in pollution-ridden waters. Results showed that the species collected from the river were categorized under Moderately Tolerant and Tolerant, hence contributing to the poor water quality of the water-source due to petroleum industry activities. Air quality was tested using hand-made air filters designed to capture particulate matter in the air. Filters were set up in four different sites around the community. By comparing the results of the air filters to a standard Air Quality Index (AQI), one was able to see that the air quality in the community was under the category: “Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups.” Lastly, 25 community members were interviewed and asked to complete a survey to analyze the social and cultural impacts the industry has on the community. The results showed that community members have uncertainty regarding the petroleum industry; many are aware of the environmental and health impacts, but know there are temporary economic benefits that can prove helpful. ",2016,"Environmental Studies,

Some countries respond swiftly to the epidemic, while other countries take many years to initiate a meaningful response. Why does the overall HIV outcome and response vary dramatically from country to country?

The exocyst complex is a highly conserved 8-protein subunit complex that functions to tether secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane, aiding in exocytosis and polarized cell growth. Additionally, interphase nodes are collections of signaling proteins that play a critical role in regulating cell division by recruiting protein kinases to the center of the cell, initiating the onset of ring constriction. However, the localization and concentration of individual protein subunits and combined effects of certain protein deletions remain unclear. By further understanding the combined roles of the exocyst and interphase nodes in S. pombe through quantitative microscopy, we can gain insight into the basic cellular processes of secretion, polarized growth, and specific mechanisms behind cell division that go awry in human diseases such as cancer, diabetes and neurodegenerative disorders.",2016,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

Whales are a powerful metaphor for politics on land, sexual predation, tyranny, and godliness. Dolphins have a unique connotation as  being friendly toward humans, going as far back as the myth of Arion on the dolphin’s back, and in Pliny’s Natural History. I,
pay particular attention to queer readings of these texts as well as to the role that gender plays in them. Highlights include illustrations of early English conceptions  of whales as scaly sea monsters, and Lyly’s Gallathea, a 1592 play in which two fair maidens cross-dress as men in order to avoid being eaten by a sea monster and fall in love with each other, each believing that the other is a man.

My thesis examines John Milton’s representation of the Garden of Eden in Paradise Lost, specifically the relationship between humans and their environment. Milton’s Eden raises questions about the role of active work in utopia, the tension between wilderness and the need for order, and expressions of desire in a garden setting. My work draws on ecocriticism by examining the prevailing environmental issues of the 17th century and the growing awareness about the negative impact  humans can have on the Earth. In addition,,
I consider other literary visions of gardens offered by Shakespeare, Spenser, and Marvell that helped shape the character of Milton’s garden. Lastly, I will speak about my tour of Renaissance-style gardens in England and how visiting gardens that Milton would have known and walked through in his lifetime has impacted my work.",2016,English; Economics,English

These “postmemories” (a term coined by scholar Marianne Hirsch) connect generations despite temporal disconnect. They have an irrefutable impact, not only on the people we become but also on the ways we perceive the world and create our own narratives. My English honors thesis, a series of original poems, explores this phenomenon, focusing on shared understandings of addiction,,
war, and trauma. Each individual recalls these common experiences vividly and subjectively, and understanding the differences in these recollections offers a valuable conception of the past. How does our narrative heritage influence our choices and views? What differentiates history and memory?

My senior thesis in history offers a new perspective on China’s transformation from a planned economy,
in the 1950s to its market reforms in the 1980s. Specifically, it explores the emergence of business structures and strategies at the enterprise level aimed at overcoming some  of the challenges that China faced as a developing socialist country. It begins with the development of small, self-sufficient,
enterprises during the Great Leap Forward, often associated with the so-called “backyard steel furnace” movement, and the shift in the 1960s to new forms of business enterprises geared toward both promoting specialization and facilitation integration. By studying how Chinese economic actors at the enterprise level overcame bottlenecks as the country underwent rapid industrialization to catch  up with advanced economies, I discover that the post-1978 reforms were foreshadowed by China’s previous experiences.",2016,Economics; History,History

The decision to drop the second atomic bomb in Nagasaki was a result of the crucible of tragic,
histories involved in the transmission of Christianity to Japan, which Japan initially rejected, even deporting missionaries and torturing and murdering converts. In spite of this anti-Christian, anti-European, and anti-colonial campaign, some converts went “underground.” Takashi Paul Nagai, the chief architect for turning Nagasaki into the “City of Prayer,” in contrast to Hiroshima, which is remembered today as the “City of,
Anger,” was a descendent of the “Clandestine Christians” of the 16th century. My research explores the Jesuit movements in Asia during the 16th century, the challenges they faced, and the transmission of Christianity to  Japan that followed into the 20th century, particularly through the eyes of Shusaku Endo, a famous Roman Catholic Japanese author of the 20th century.",2018,Unspecified,Religion

How did African leaders and urban planners overcome the challenges inherited from colonialism? Finally, how did the ideologies of African postcolonial leaders influence urban plans?

A lack of access to the technical training required to develop compositional skills is often cited as a primary reason female composers struggled to reach the same prominence as their male colleagues. Living in an ostensibly egalitarian society, Gubaidulina and Ustvolskaya were treated as equal to their male counterparts and given greater access to education than many women in the West. This increased access to musical education represents an unprecedented experiment in classical music history. Both Gubaidulina and Ustvolskaya developed compositional styles that are neither traditional nor avant-garde but strikingly unique, and thus reflect a shared desire for musical independence and originality.

The conspicuous absence of menstruation in literature piqued my interest, inspiring me to take on an investigatory independent study, but its elusiveness also proved to be a research roadblock. In response to this challenge, I decided that the most effective way to gather qualitative data on my topic was to create a primary text in the form of a zine. The zine, titled That Time of the Month, takes a calendar format due to the monthly cyclicality of traditional menstruation, and features submissions from Wellesley students.

The Occupation (1940-1944) was marked not only by the daily stress of living alongside the German enemy, but also by a civil war within the French population. Existing critical works on Irène Némirovsky, a Russian-Jewish author writing in France during the Occupation, focus on fitting her wartime writing into a certain political and ideological framework; however, these attempts to label Némirovsky’s political stance are far too reductive. In my thesis, I have taken the opposite approach, seeking to bring to light the complexity of Némirovsky’s ambivalent representation of Germans, as well as of French elites and women, to show that rather than producing unequivocal propaganda works, Némirovsky employs these external and internal enemies to French national solidarity in order to consider timeless ethical questions regarding individual responsibility and collective identity.",2016,French,French

In the media, the predominant black female tropes have been the Mammy, Jezebel, and Sapphire, each of which have negative effects on the black woman’s psyche through her internalization of these images. In response, directors and actresses, many of whom are black, have deconstructed and proposed new, more compelling representations of black womanhood. Through the analysis of popular black female tropes and the current mass media representation of black women, I argue that a new representation of black womanhood has developed that encompasses previous tropes yet differentiates itself by exhibiting a multidimensional woman with humanizing, rather than degrading, traits.Écrire l’occupation: Representations of the Enemy in Three Works by Irène Némirovsky",2017,Economics,Africana Studies

I was placed in the Department of Politique de la Ville, a national funding mechanism dedicated to low-income neighborhoods in France during its call to reform. At its best, the mechanism is quite dynamic, increasing the resources and mutual trust between residents and government; at its worst, it is highly ineffective, financially wasteful, and ignorant of the specific needs of communities. While most research students spend months piled over books, I spent months sitting in and listening to focus groups, community presentations, and internal department debates, a fly on the many walls of French bureaucracy and law making. This research experience played an important role in cementing my interest in urban conflict and, more importantly, was essential in my understanding of the give and take between local government and community organizing.

These paintings are exceptional for the period in that nudity was primarily reserved for allegorical or mythological contexts. The identity of the women depicted in these mysterious paintings has been a continual source of fascination for scholars, who have suggested an array of royal mistresses and queens. Beyond the women’s precise identities, however, the paintings elicit many questions; their meaning, their function, and what they reveal to us about women of the period all remain to be explored. The paintings are examined in light of contemporary conceptions of bathing and bathing practices revealed to us through plans and accounts of François I’s renowned appartement des bains at the Chateau de Fontainebleau, prints and illustrations of bathing scenes, and prescriptive texts on bathing.

2871,2016,"Beyond the Loom: Examining the Relationship Among Gender, Textiles, and Architecture at the Bauhaus",Orli Hakanoglu,Patricia Berman,"Established in 1919, the Bauhaus school of art, design, and architecture, known for its radical social and artistic experimentation, was arguably the most influential institution on modern design. Although women were accepted into the school, the agenda of equality did not reach so far as to fully include them in the curriculum. Women were redirected from the study of architecture to the weaving workshop. Consequently, modern textiles—from movie screens to light-reflecting and sound-absorbing fabric—were radically transformed by ambitious women. Prompted by the discrepancy between the school’s mission and its lack of gender equality, my interdisciplinary thesis examines the ways in which women reclaimed their place at the school by revolutionizing their medium. I specifically consider the work and writing of Anni Albers within the framework of gender politics of the Bauhaus. The studio portion of my thesis imagines the spatial potential of the textiles woven by women who were denied the opportunity to work in architecture. (Research",2016,Architecture,Art

I also chose to focus on lightbulbs for their symbolic meaning. It is ironic that the incandescent light bulb, the quintessential symbol of technology and innovation, is itself becoming obsolete as it is steadily replaced by LED bulbs, fluorescent bulbs, and other forms of lighting.,
Over the semester I explored new mold-making and casting techniques, as well as new materials, each with their own opportunities and challenges. My finished piece is composed of plastic and plaster representations of glass light bulbs which are encased in clear plastic.

Known by her title from her first marriage, Empress Matilda played a pivotal role in the first English Civil War. She fought against her cousin, Stephen of Blois, for her right to rule independently as England’s true monarch, transcended gender boundaries of the time, and ultimately, through her son, founded the House of Plantagenet.,

For Cervantes, an itinerant migrant throughout his life, his experience in the Maghreb represented his first real encounters with “otherness” in a national, religious, and ethnic context. This thesis, therefore, will explore the complex role of migration in the works of Cervantes though the voices of his female characters.

Is love translatable? The theory of conceptual metaphor, drawn from cognitive linguistics, proposes that metaphors are not simply formalistic techniques but conceptual categories that structure our understanding of the world. Due to the aid of conceptual metaphors, culturally specific definitions of vast and ambiguous concepts such as “love” could definitely be translated across the borders of both language and culture through a parallel with concrete and universally applicable elements. First, I will discuss the origination of culturally specific conceptual metaphors in Western and Chinese traditions from the perspective of cultural psychology; then I will analyze the presence of those conceptual metaphors in literature.

Evaluating the Localization of Sid2p/Mob1p During Cytokinesis,
Lois M. Kwon ’16, Biological Sciences,
 John Goss, Biological Sciences,
Interphase nodes are collections of signaling proteins that play a critical role in regulating cell division. These nodes function to recruit protein kinases to the center of the cell that signal the onset of contractile ring constriction. Using Schizosaccharomyces pombe, or fission yeast, as a model organism, recent research has revealed two interphase node proteins, Blt1p and Gef2p, to be individually implicated in recruiting the Sid2p/Mob1p kinase complex to initiate ring constriction. However, the combined effects of the deletion of Blt1p and Gef2p still remain unclear. My thesis therefore aims to observe whether or not the deletion of both proteins will result in an additive or redundant effect. Establishment of a “molecular clock” will enable us to directly compare the timing of the formation and constriction of the contractile ring across strains, and additional quantitative analysis will further reveal density levels of Sid2p/Mob1p kinase complex at the division plane.,
Hybridization: Understanding the Invasive Impact of an Introduced Species on Endemic Species in the Galápagos Archipelago,
Sarah J. Pangburn ’16, Biological Sciences,
 Andrea Sequeira, Biological Sciences,
Introduced species threaten endemic species through competitive exclusion, niche displacement, introgression, predation, and hybridization. As a result of hybridization, endemic species can lose important genetic adaptations. Small island populations of endemic species are especially in danger of extinction due to hybridization. The Galapaganus weevil system colonized the Galápagos Archipelago between 8.6 and 11.5 million years ago from continental Ecuador. However, genetic analyses indicate that Galapaganus. h. howdenae was only just recently introduced to Santa Cruz Island via an accidental human-mediated introduction during the human colonization period (1832-1959). This introduced species could now threaten the status of endemic species on the island, Galapagnus conwayensis and Galapaganus ashlocki, by weakening their biological identity through interspecies hybridization. An analysis of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA was completed using the Isolation with Migration model in order to determine the occurrence of hybridization and possibly the extent of the impact of the introduction.,
Observing the Microbial Community Dynamics of a Permafrost Thaw Ecosystem,

Due to climate change, thawing permafrost may cause a release of stored carbon, which can increase concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Global warming has been most extreme at northern latitudes. In northern Sweden, warming already has impacted the ecosystems and communities that make up this area. To address how microbial community is affected by the changing landscape, I collected longtitudinal samples of roots and leaves of seven different plant species across three permafrost thaw zones and profiled the microbial communities using high throughput sequencing. The comparative analysis of the data will be used to answer questions about ecological secession and community formation in these permafrost environments, and to begin characterizing microorganisms involved in mediating carbon fluxes in wetland ecosystems. This study integrates with a larger project on how microbial systems respond to and contribute to global change. In my talk, I will explain the observed colonization patterns and their significance, and how these communities fit in a dynamic and vulnerable permafrost system.",,Biological Sciences,Unspecified

In the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, proliferative actions associated with metamorphosis are preceded by a decline in the levels of JH. This project tested the hypothesis that the proliferation of imaginal cells, which are stem cell-like, is controlled by the interaction between JH and the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. In situ hybridization was used to localize gene expression of Hh in imaginal cells. In vitro gene knockdown of Hh signaling components led to altered imaginal cell proliferation patterns. Because nutrients are essential for imaginal cell proliferation, Hh expression was analyzed in starved animals. In the absence of nutrients, Hh expression declined. These studies demonstrate that a link exists between imaginal cell proliferation and Hh signaling. Further studies are underway to establish the relationship between JH and Hh signaling",2018,Unspecified,Biological Sciences

Manduca sexta, a insect physiology model organism, has distinct size sensing points—the minimum viable weight (MVW), the critical weight (CW), and the threshold weight (TW)—that mark decisions in the course of insect development. Manduca sexta goes through five larval molts before progressing into the pupal stage, provided that it reaches a weight minimum known as the threshold weight; otherwise, a supernumerary larval stage develops. The research presented in this talk explores the effects of hypoxia and juvenile hormone (JH) on the threshold weight in Manduca sexta, and candidate proteins that might mediate the decision to progress to metamorphosis or recapitulate the larval stage.",2016,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences
2901,2016,Transcriptional Regulation of Ecdysteroid Biosynthesis Is Conserved Between Hemimetabolous and Holometabolous Insects,Prioty Sarwar,Yuichiro Suzuki,"Hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects are insects that undergo incomplete and complete metamorphosis, respectively. Recent studies have shown that in holometabolous insects, Ventral veins lacking (Vvl), a POU domain transcription factor, regulates ecdysteroid biosynthesis to influence molting and metamorphosis. To determine the degree of conservation in the transcriptional control of the insect endocrine system, the expression of Vvl in the hemimetabolous insect Oncopeltus fasciatus was silenced by RNA interference. As a result, the nymphs failed to molt and eventually died. Vvl knockdown also led to reduced expression of the ecdysone response gene HR3. Injection of active ecdysone 20E into Vvl knockdown nymphs rescued the HR3 expression and the molting phenotype. Vvl knockdown also led to subsequent reduction in the levels of ecdysone biosynthesis genes. Therefore, the transcriptional regulation of ecdysteroid biosynthesis is conserved between hemimetabolous and holometabolous insects.",2016,Biochemistry,Biological Sciences

Those who have are often asked to donate to NGOs, usually through promotional materials featuring powerful narratives, images of success, and reports offering quantifiable results. While NGOs face pressure to produce evidence of success that will justify continued funding, the effort to generate such data may preclude working on long-term, systemic issues. It may also lead NGOs to develop programs that respond more to donor trends rather than local demands. Using ethnographic work by anthropologists concerning the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa, I intend to show how the position occupied by NGOs creates a double bind and restricts their ability to perform necessary work.

Using a retrospective study of children presenting with incidentally identified pituitary adenomas, we found that a quarter of these children exhibited no functional or radiological changes over the duration of follow-up in their medical history. Therefore, we suggest that an incidentally identified pediatric pituitary microadenoma is more likely to be benign and nonfunctioning.

2906,2016,Studying Drug-Receptor Interactions: Photolabeling Studies Related to Type II Diabetes,Erin Yang,David Haines,"Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) is a pancreatic receptor and a target for Type II diabetes treatment. Although injection of GLP-1 leads to insulin release, its short half-life makes GLP-1 difficult to use as a drug. Like GLP-1, the small molecule T-0632 binds selectively to GLP-1R. Understanding the interactions between T-0632 and GLP-1R may provide insights into diabetes drug design. To study these interactions, we will create a library of T-0632 analogs possessing a reactive azide (N3) group in a variety of locations. Upon photolysis, the azide will covalently bind to specific amino acids within GLP-1R, thereby allowing us to map the residues of GLP-1R that are in proximity to T-0632. We have focused on selectively iodinating the isoquinoline of T-0632, with iodine being a precursor to the azide. Our method allows for selectivity in labeling ligands in order to map their binding pockets in biological receptors.",2016,Chemistry,Chemistry
2907,2016,Impacts of a High-Fat Diet on the Growth of Intestinal Stem Cells and Cellular Models,Cynthia Jung,Omer Yilmaz,"Intestinal cancer and this organ’s microenvironment have previously been little understood. The intestines contain epithelial intestinal stem cells (ISCs), which self-renew and differentiate into various specialized cell types. ISCs alter their function in response to the nutritional state of their microenvironment, which initiates growth factors that maintain the ISCs. Our research focused on the high-fat diet’s role on the growth of cancerous intestinal stem cells. Experiments involving both human and mouse ISCs have indicated that this diet induces tumorigenesis. Using mimics of this dietary condition and pathway targeting components, we investigated impacts on fatty acid metabolism in cancerous ISC cellular models using physiological and mechanic analytical methods. In addition, we studied germline mutations in colon cancer to study the effect on colonic stem cells. Our findings are a step toward future clinical and patient-specific treatment.",2017,Mathematics,Biological Sciences
2908,2016,Alternative Methods of Reductive Amination in the Synthesis of T-0632 Analogs in Order to Study Receptors Involved in Type II Diabetes,Emma Ambrogi,David Haines,"T-0632 is a small-molecule inverse agonist of the pancreatic receptor GLP-1R. In order to study the binding site of GLP-1R, a receptor of great interest in Type II diabetes research, we hope to conduct photoaffinity labeling studies of the receptor using T-0632. To achieve this, multiple isomers of azido-T-0632 are needed. In the synthesis of azido-T-0632, it is necessary to achieve reductive amination of an oxime without affecting aromatic halogens. Catalytic hydrogenation, the standard method for reduction of oximes, cleanly removes aromatic iodide under the conditions necessary for oxime reduction, so an alternative reduction method is needed. This study examines the effectiveness of reductive amination of oximes using sodium borohydride and lithium aluminum hydride. The results of the oxime reduction studies will be presented, including a discussion of reduction selectivity of the reagents. Any viable reduction method must selectively reduce the intermediate, usually an oxime, without removing any aromatic iodides.",2016,Chemistry,Chemistry

In organisms that can regenerate limbs, a key step in regeneration is the de-differentiation of cells to form a blastema.,
In this study, we sought to identify blastema-specific factors in the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. An RNA-seq analysis identified a POU domain transcription factor as a potential blastema factor. Findings show that upon gene silencing, regenerating limbs were notably smaller, most likely due to decreased duration of blastema maintenance. A GFP enhancer trap line indicated that the expression of this gene is upregulated during the blastema maintenance phase. Thus, the POU domain transcription factor appears to regulate the duration of the blastema stage to ultimately regulate limb size.",2016,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

2911,2016,Studying DNA Hairpin Stability and Octahedral Rhodium Complex Binding,Sally Ruderman,Megan Nunez,"The stability of the double helix of our DNA is integral to accurate transcription and translation. However, if mismatches wobble pairs or lesions in the DNA disrupt the typical Watson-Crick base pairings, the stability and integrity of the entire molecule plummets. Although structurally quite different from normal double-stranded DNA, palindromic, single-stranded DNA hairpins are a remarkably accurate model to study DNA stability. Pulling on these hairpins with optical tweezers reveals how much force is needed to “unzip” the DNA, whether perfectly matched or with mistakes. Some rhodium-based octahedral complexes are DNA intercalators, molecules that bind between the DNA bases, and are hypothesized to stabilize any mistakes or lesions in the DNA. For my thesis, I am using DNA hairpins in conjunction with two rhodium complexes, Rh(bpy)2(chrysi)+3 and Rh(bpy)2(phi)+3, both of which are DNA intercalators. I am investigating whether and how these complexes bind, stabilize, and interact with the DNA hairpins.",2016,Biochemistry,Chemistry

However, there is a tendency for strands with an abundance of guanines to form G-quadruplexes via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. The structures have the power to inhibit telomerase activity, replication, and transcription.

Dietary restriction has been demonstrated to extend the life of multiple species, including Caenorhabditis elegans. Recent studies have found a molecular pathway where a-ketoglutarate (a-KG), a Krebs cycle intermediate, prolongs the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans in dietary restriction. In this model organism, Glu intervenes in two different set of reactions that produce a-KG, but whether Glu transport affects longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans has not been investigated yet. An ongoing project in the Bauer lab explores the aging phenotype of Caenorhabditis elegans glutamate transporter mutants with respect to wild type to understand whether a deficiency in Glu transport interferes with lifespan.",2018,Neuroscience,Neuroscience
2915,2016,Characterizing the Adhesive Properties of Cytokine Receptor IL17Ra During Brain Development,Ashley Park,Adam Matthews,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social behavior, communication, and characteristic repetitive behaviors. Studies have revealed that environmental factors, such as maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy, play significant roles in the pathogenesis of ASD, especially in individuals with specific genetic backgrounds. This observation has been modeled in rodents to better understand the neuronal basis of MIA-induced ASD phenotypes. The Choi lab at MIT has recently discovered that a specific immune molecule named cytokine interleukin (IL)-17a is necessary in female mice to induce ASD-like phenotypes in the MIA offspring. For my thesis project, I have been characterizing the cell adhesive properties of the cell-surface receptor IL17Ra, which IL-17a binds to, and determining the role this receptor plays during fetal development. Elucidating the role of IL17Ra could lead to more definitive diagnostic tools and preventative methods of ASD, both of which are critically lacking.T1",2016,Neuroscience,Biological Sciences
2916,2016,Investigating the Interaction Between the Cardiac Potassium Channels hERG and KvLQ,Heidi Wade,Louise Darling,"The heartbeat is triggered by the collective electrical activity of individual heart cells called cardiomyocytes. The electrical activity of cardiomyocytes is due to the influx of sodium and calcium ions into cardiomyocytes and the efflux of potassium ions out of cardiomyocytes. Aberrations in the flow of ions into and out of cardiomyocytes can underlie a variety of arrhythmias and diseases. While there is only a single sodium channel protein that is responsible for the influx of sodium ions into cardiomyocytes, there are more than five different potassium channel proteins that are responsible for the efflux of potassium from cardiomyocytes. Historically, it has been assumed that the excess of potassium currents were acting as a repolarization reserve, meaning if there was a block or a mutation in one potassium channel that rendered it to have reduced or nonfunction, then the other potassium channels could compensate for this through increased activity. However, the idea that excess potassium channels are acting as a repolarization reserve has been challenged by research showing that loss of function in one kind of potassium channel, hERG, resulted in the reduced function of another potassium channel protein, KvLQT1, and vice versa. Subsequent studies showed that hERG and KvLQT1 physically interact with each other, but the exact nature of their interaction remains unknown. I am interested in further elucidating the nature of interaction between hERG and KvLQT1 measuring acceptor photobleach FRET (apFRET) between fluorescently labeled hERG and KvLQT1 proteins. Specifically, I am addressing whether interchanging the fluorophores that hERG and KvLQT1 are tagged with affects the FRET efficiency between the two proteins. In addition, I am examining whether the concatenation of minK (protein) to KvLQT1, so the construct can produce full IKs (potassium currant) current seen in an intact cardiomyocyte, alters the interaction between KvLQT1 and hERG. Answering fundamental questions about how the various ion channel proteins interact in both normal and diseased cardiomyocytes will enhance our understanding about the molecular basis of many complex cardiac diseases.",2016,Biochemistry,Biological Sciences

Although it is thought that mammalian neuronal stem cells self-renew, the neuronal precursors found in the crayfish Procambarus clarkii and Procambarus fallax lack this ability, and instead must be replenished by an extrinsic source. Recent studies have demonstrated that the immune system serves as a source of precursor cells. To enhance our understanding of the relationship between adult neurogenesis and the immune system, we are investigating the physiological and molecular interactions between these two systems. Our aims include (1) defining the electrophysiological properties of immune-derived cells that integrate into the brain; (2) examining the influences of serotonin and astakine, an immune system cytokine, on adult neurogenesis; and (3) studying the characteristics of cultured immune cells and how different agents can bias them toward a neuronal fate.",,Neuroscience,Unspecified
2920,2016,Tutor-Complete: An Educational Game and Intelligent Tutoring System for Languages and Automata,Katherine Kjeer,Eniana Mustafaraj,"Educational games and intelligent tutoring systems have been shown to improve student learning outcomes by increasing engagement and providing individualized instruction. However, while introductory programming students frequently benefit from such systems, students in upper-level theoretical courses such as CS235 (Languages and Automata) have dense textbooks and dry mathematical readings as their primary or only resources. Tutor-Complete aims to fill this gap by presenting two fundamental CS235 concepts in a game environment. In the first activity, students construct deterministic finite-state automata in order to guide their character across a landscape. In the second activity, students build proofs using the pumping lemma to defeat the “villain” character. Tutor-Complete also fosters a peer-learning environment by encouraging students to explain concepts to each other and providing hints based on past student work.

Personal genomic data are also unique because, unlike other personal data, which constantly change, genomic data are largely stable during a person’s lifetime; it is the interpretation and implications of that data that change over time as new medical research exposes relationships between genes and health. Over the summer, we developed a tool for self-exploration of personal genomic data.

Multithreading is a common model for concurrent software, in which multiple threads of execution running at the same time share the data they use. Since threads are able to run in parallel, tasks may complete faster. However, multithreading is prone to errors when threads try to update and use shared data simultaneously. There exist tools in development to find these errors, but they lack in performance and accuracy. We built tools for profiling program behavior patterns. By identifying these patterns, we will use them to design optimizations of existing tools and save on their associated costs. This presentation explores the profiling results and patterns from these tools and what they suggest in terms of optimization.

Consider the schedule of events happening at a conference; we can say that one event is “less than” another if the former ends before the latter begins, but if they overlap in time, then the events are called “incomparable.” The events together with this ordering form what is called a partial order. In fact, they form a special type of partial order, called an interval order. In this talk, we will address questions such as the following: Which partial orders come from schedules?

Arguably the most important structure found within a ring is what we call an ideal, which is a subset of the rings element that is closed under addition within that subset, and closed under multiplication by any element in the ring as a whole. In 2013, Professor Diesl of the Mathematics Department defined a property of elements of rings called “nil clean,” and we will extend this notion by defining it for ideals of rings.

Previous methods of confining light using nanophotonic resonances rely on high-index contrast between the photonic structure and the surrounding medium. As the index contrast decreases, the light becomes less confined and eventually disappears. To reduce the substrate leakage, metals or high-index dielectric materials are often used, but both absorb energy and reduce device performance. Using the scale structure of the Dione juno butterfly wing, which contains only low-index biological materials, we present and experimentally demonstrate a new class of surface structures that can support resonances without index contrast with the substrate.

2939,2016,Vision and Art: Independent Interdisciplinary Investigations of the Human Visual System,Nancy Zhang; Ali Johnson; Jessica Kelemen; Hope Fuller-Becker; Amanda Fath; Sydney Cadiz,Bevil Conway,"Our neuroscience course, Vision and Art, was an interdisciplinary investigation of the human visual system incorporating physiology, art, physics, and neurobiology. We use visual art to motivate our examinations of the fundamental physiological and computational processes of vision. Harmoniously understanding the integration among various components of the visual system provides a unique framework for how we view and create art. Panelists integrated their diverse interests with their inquiries of the visual system through a term project. The topics of the panel include: investigating racial defeminization of black women by tracking eye movements upon viewing images of black and white men and women; performance of computer vision algorithms on face detection in Cubist art; effects of color association of familiar objects on color memory; music-color association mediated by emotion; color and emotion relation; and determining the innate or learned nature of color memory.",,Neuroscience,Unspecified

Histone-derived antimicrobial peptides (HDAPs) are one class of AMPs that are derived from histones, which are proteins best known for packaging nucleic acids in cell nuclei. While AMPs are known to either permeabilize the membrane to induce cell lysis or translocate across the membrane to interfere with intracellular processes, little is understood about the specific binding targets. The lab is in the process of developing computational models with molecular dynamics and experimental approaches utilizing confocal microscopy, cellular assays, and spectroscopic measurements to investigate mechanisms of action. By modifying and studying the relationship between peptide structure, amino acid composition, and peptide function, the Elmore lab hopes to improve the therapeutic potential of AMPs in a clinical setting.",,Biological Chemistry,Unspecified

2942,2016,Evaluating the Potential of Alkaline Battery Oxide Powders to Reduce Lead Mobility in Urban Agricultural Settings,Nisreen Abo-Sido; Ciaran Gallagher,Daniel Brabander,"Urban agriculture in many Boston communities increases food sovereignty, strengthens community ties, and promotes youth leadership development. However, elevated levels of the neurotoxin lead in urban soils requires the development of best practices to minimize exposure. Adding municipal compost minimizes the resuspension of highly contaminated fine soils and may alter the geomobility of lead. We are investing the use of manganese oxide (MnO) to reduce the geomobility of lead in various soil matrices. MnO is being sourced from spent alkaline batteries to minimize cost and repurpose the 3.5 billion alkaline batteries used annually in the U.S. We planted the hyperaccumulators mustards in compost, soil, and a compost-soil mixture with and without MnO amendment. Since green leafy vegetables are commonly grown in urban settings and have been shown to bioaccumulate lead, we aim to further refine best practices for sustainable urban agriculture by exploring cost-effective and environmentally beneficial protocols.",,Environmental Studies,Geosciences

Calderas form when a magma chamber rapidly drains and the overlying rock collapses. If the caldera interpretation is correct, then the volcanic rocks in the Blue Hills must be older than the rocks (including the Quincy Granite and Hancock Porphyry) that would have crystallized in the chamber. U-Pb geochronology will establish absolute ages for these rocks and thus the sequence of events. The volcanics and Quincy Granite have already been dated.

However, both natural and human-induced stressors can result in pollen dearth in colonies, which may impact growing larvae that rely on the nutrients from pollen for proper development. This project’s goal was to examine the effects of pollen dearth during larval development on the ability of workers to care for (or “nurse”) larvae when they become adults. Focal workers were reared as larvae in colonies that had either inadequate or abundant pollen supplies for brood rearing, and then were monitored for their nursing behavior when they were adults. Focal bees were also assessed for hypopharyngeal gland development, which is an important physiological marker of nursing behavior. Our study will provide insight into the important role that pollen stress plays in supporting the function of healthy and productive honeybee colonies.",2016,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences
2945,2016,The Influence of Predatory Chemical Cues on the Foraging Behavior of Hogna Lenta Wolf Spiders,Ellice Patterson,Christa Skow,"Larger predators can influence smaller predators’ foraging behavior. This experiment, conducted as an independent research project under the guidance of Christa Skow, sought to examine these influences. My hypothesis, based on Wilder and Rypstra’s study (2004), was that the smaller predator Hogna lenta wolf spider’s foraging behavior will be greatly inhibited by the chemical cues of larger predators, tarantulas. The chemical cues of tarantulas were obtained and placed in a testing arena with wolf spiders. Each wolf spider was tested separately to see if the tarantulas’ chemical cues would inhibit or encourage the wolf spider’s cricket consumption, the measure of successful foraging. Different factors of foraging behavior, such as time spent immobile, number of crickets consumed, and distance traveled, were analyzed to see how these aspects were influenced by predatory chemical cues and therefore if successful foraging occurred.",2016,Biological Sciences,Biological Sciences

Using science fiction, I create a decolonial, imaginary, rupturing space for alternative voices to come through. Written from the intersection of imagination and identity, sci-fi and theater, the story is rooted in my own experiences as a transracial, transnational adoptee, in the work of Corean unwed mothers, and in oral histories of adopted Coreans.

The poster will answer questions related to regulations and political attitudes by gender and citizenship: What are individuals’ reasons and politics behind border crossing and fertility treatments? Prior to and after conception, how do the individuals feel about using donors? How do parents think about genetics? The study data comes from online surveys sent in various languages between November 2014 and January 2015 to former patients of a clinic in Spain who conceived children in the last five years. While the typical explanation given for why people border cross to use gametes to conceive is financial, data on this small exploratory study show otherwise, revealing that people are border crossing because fertility treatments did not work in their own countries, because they wanted an anonymous donor, or because donor eggs and embryos were not allowed in their countries of citizenship. In addition, individuals border crossed despite contradictory personal feelings about donor use and reproductive regulation. Respondents suggest that the meaning of genes varies by country. In conclusion, border crossing may not be as simple as it seems. While the respondents who border crossed place a lot of importance on genes, many of them are against expanding reproductive liberty and are against disclosing genetic information to their children. Additional conclusions are yet to be determined.",2017,Mathematics,Women's and Gender Studies

Much of our focus on evolution revolves around natural selection, a focus that has led us to believe that any beneficial trait has the possibility of evolving over time within a population. My interview with Wellesley professor Emily Buchholtz considered why this perspective is incomplete: It overlooks the developmental constraints to evolution, constraints that limit the traits generated in viable individuals prior to natural selection ever taking place. By identifying organisms that have managed to break the constraints and studying at both a molecular and morphological level the consequences of their divergence, we learn more about the developmental constraints themselves, as well as evolution and development as a whole.,

Iconicity is not uniform: A symbol can iconically represent how a human interacts with the referent or the shape of the referent. This study investigates whether children learn various types of iconic symbols differently over the course of development. I hypothesize that children will learn handling gestures, which depict how an object is used (e.g., gesturing “brushing teeth” by pretending to hold a toothbrush), more easily than object gestures, in which the hand represents the referent (e.g., gesturing “brushing teeth” by extending the pointer finger out to represent the shape of a toothbrush).

My research investigates how cultural values may influence the endorsement of onset responsibility and courtesy stigma. I hypothesized that participants from different ethno-cultural groups would vary in their cultural values, and that these values would be positively associated with courtesy stigma and negatively associated with onset responsibility. Furthermore, we explore stigmatizing attitudes endorsed by parents and qualitatively assess how parents explain mental illnesses to their children.

We hypothesized that verbs would elicit gesture productions that showed how the child would interact with an object (handling gestures), whereas nouns would elicit gestures that showed the shape of an object (object gestures). Preschool children (N=116) between the ages of 3 to 5 were randomly assigned to produce six gestures in response to either verbs or nouns.

My thesis situates nursing in the Israeli context not solely as a calling but additionally as a political act. Caring for one’s “enemy,” in physical, psychological, and emotional terms, places nurses in the unique position of peace worker in addition to their professional tasks. The ability of women to fulfill this role is intrinsically linked to their own training as “mothers.” Israeli nurses, cognizant of the ramifications of their multiple roles, employ “maternal thinking” (Ruddick 1989) in order to build relationships rooted in understanding. Building a relationship with their patients allows them to give the best medical care possible and is considered a crucial aspect of holistic nursing.

Do calorie labels offend your autonomy? If your Happy Meal came with water, would you ask for soda? Over the past 10 years, insights from the field of behavioral economics have been increasingly incorporated into government policies that aim to improve the public’s well-being in all areas of life. While some see these so-called “libertarian paternalistic” or “nudge” policies as less restrictive than traditional paternalism, others worry about their lack of transparency, impact on freedom, and even inefficacy. In my senior thesis, I examine the philosophical arguments regarding these strategies, with a special focus on obesity prevention and the three policies alluded to above.

Participants were 181 females who completed assessments of body image, sexual risk, attachment style, and dating app usage. There was a positive correlation between dating app usage and risky sexual behavior, but this was not mediated by body esteem. Results showed that individuals with anxious attachment had lower body image than those with secure attachment and that anxiously attached individuals were more likely to use dating applications. There was a trend for those with a preoccupied attachment style to be slightly more sexually risky than individuals with fearful avoidant attachment.",2016,Psychology,Psychology
2975,2016,Examining the Effect of Language Brokering on College Students,Cordelia Zhong ; Kaeum (Anni)Kim; Jennifer Guzman,Sally Theran,"This study examined language brokering among Wellesley College students. We expected that Asian-American and Latina-American students would be more likely to be language brokers. Drawing on previous research findings, language brokers were hypothesized to experience greater role conflict, detrimentally affecting various levels of college adjustment. Compared to Caucasian-American peers, both Asian- and Latina-American students’ language brokered more frequently, but experiences of role conflict and college adjustment were found to be more nuanced. While role conflict was not a significant mediator for college adjustment, Asian-American language brokers were more likely to experience poorer adjustment in regards to their academic performance than the other groups. These results contribute to sparse literature following language brokers’ experiences in the college environment. Implications and limitations of this study are considered, as well as ways in which future research can be inclusive of college language brokers.",,Psychology,Psychology

The impostor phenomenon was positively correlated with depression, anxiety and stress levels, worse college adjustment, and anxious attachment style. These results indicate that students who,
experience more impostor phenomenon feelings have more negative mental health outcomes and worse personal-emotional adjustment to college. While no evidence was found that IP feelings are related to satisfaction and co-rumination in close friendships, the results of the current study indicate that students with more IP feelings exhibit more anxious attachment in their close relationships and experience worse social adjustment in college.",2016,Psychology,Psychology

Urban School Choice: Inequity by Zip-Code",Elizabeth (Ellie) Dougherty; Mehak Sarang; Karen Su,Thomas Cushman,"This presentation focuses on equity in the American educational system. For children in low-income communities, education plays a central role in escaping poverty. Nonetheless, many children grow up in neighborhoods with schools that cannot provide sufficient resources for them to succeed. Consequently, children across America are left unable to compete educationally in comparison to their middle-and upper-socioeconomic peers. How is it possible for students who grow up in disadvantaged communities to escape poverty and achieve social mobility when their playing fields are unequal from the start? In an effort to unravel the complexities of this issue, our presentations will focus on the public school system of Boston, a city in which families have the choice to send their children outside of their ZIP codes to better-performing schools. We analyze the various models of education that comprise the Boston system, such as public, magnet, charter, and private schools, and offer policy suggestions on how the system can be improved overall.",,Sociology,Unspecified

I ask whether male and female artists differ in how they speak about potential, present, or past lovers in songs about relationships in terms of love and power. Using narrative coding and quantitative analyses, I hope to identify gender-specific patterns similar to those that sociolinguists have found in male and female conversational speech. Furthermore, I expect to see an increase in lyric length, expressions of power, and sexual references over time for all genres.",2016,Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences,French

At the turn of the 20th century, Chinese experienced massive reconstruction. Its written language evolved from its traditional wenyan form to the current modern vernacular, also known as baihua. During this change, Chinese experienced Europeanization, a process in which certain Western linguistic structures are utilized in Chinese grammatical structure. I will discuss this evolution by taking a look into various sources from the time period such as newspapers, opinion pieces, or academic writing, and demonstrate the ways in which the Europeanization of Chinese progressed over time. Then, I will consider the possible factors for why Europeanization occurred: whether they were aesthetic and cultural, or whether they were useful for new, evolving forms of complex expression. Finally, I will look at how these Western linguistic structures became accepted and conventionalized in the Chinese written vernacular.",2016,Cognitive and Linguistic Sciences,East Asian Studies

Disability services, like offering automatic subtitles at conferences, would be aided by a system that accounts for varying accents. Areas such as immigration and national security would also benefit from automated systems that could detect English speakers of Chinese, Arabic, and many other backgrounds. For my thesis, I am coding machine-learning algorithms to classify accents from foreign-accented English.

Children with insufficient iron stores demonstrate diminished cognitive and physical capacity, weakened immune systems, and developmental abnormalities. These critical individual effects, plus spillover effects at the community or country level, make iron deficiency one of the key public health concerns facing policy makers in India. In 2013, India’s federal government instituted the Iron and Folic Acid Supplementation Program (IFASP) to reduce the prevalence of childhood anemia by providing supplementation in schools. I use school-level program uptake data to study the variation in implementation of the IFASP and then exploit that variation to examine the effect of the IFASP on children’s hemoglobin levels and other nutritional outcomes.",2016,Economics,Economics

Estimates suggest that 40 percent of the combatants in Colombia’s decades-long conflict are women. However, the complex role that women have played has largely been overlooked. Much of the literature on conflict resolution assumes a dichotomy in which women are either “victims” or “perpetrators.” In reality, the distinction between these absolute categories is never entirely clear. The purpose of my trip was to examine women’s particular experiences as combatants, looking at the circumstances that led them to join the FARC, the roles they played within the organization, and their transition back into mainstream society. My research revealed that there is no easy distinction between victims and perpetrators in the conflict, as the majority of female combatants describe an ambiguous experience in which coercion, consent, empowerment, and abuse coexist in uneasy and tenuous relationships.",2016,International-Relations: Political Science,Political Science

I focus on the principles of just cause, right intention, and proper authority, and consider the role of motivations and interests in determining the permissibility and legitimacy of an intervention. I argue that the permissibility of a U.S.-led intervention in Syria cannot be determined in isolation from (1) an evaluation of the core and peripheral interests that are driving the intervening agent, the U.S.; (2) a consideration of the historic and contemporary role of the U.S. in the region as well as the legacy of Iraq and Afghanistan; and (3) an appreciation of how the intervention will be perceived by observing states.

I look at Cape Malay identity through the lens of food, as food is an important marker of tradition and culture.

He lists the following features of friendship, among others: a friend wishes and does good or apparent good to her friend for the friend’s own sake, spends time with her friend, and shares her friend’s enjoyments and distresses. Drawing from Aristotle’s books on friendship, the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics, I offer an interpretation of Aristotle’s account of self-love and consider how self-love differs from selfishness, friendship with oneself, and wishing well for oneself.

Rethinking Criminalization of Prostitution",Holly Raiborn; Margaret Flynn Sapia,Thomas Cushman,"Prostitution generates an estimated $100 billion in revenue annually worldwide, with an estimated 42 million prostitutes throughout the world. There are varying degrees of legality of prostitution in Western countries. Within these countries, there are variations in the way the law treats the individuals within the industry. In the United States, most of the individuals (69 percent) prosecuted for prostitution are the women offering the service. Women bear an unequal amount of the legal burden in countries with policies like the United States’. The alternative is what has been called “the Swedish model.” This model, which has been adopted by Norway, Iceland, Canada, and Northern Ireland, has decriminalized the act of selling sex but criminalized buying sex, pimping, or operating a brothel.

Young children cannot appreciate this level of complexity, yet when asked to describe themselves using only one descriptor, they tend to choose gender over race, ethnicity, and even age. Right from the start, gender plays a prominent role in our developing sense of self. One of the primary vehicles that children use to explore and learn about gender is play.

2995,2016,How Our Irritable Selves Read the Emotions of Others,Alexandra (Ali) Roule,Christen Deveney,"Children with chronic and severe irritability demonstrate marked problems in their relationships. These difficulties may be due to an impaired ability to recognize emotions in others’ facial expressions (e.g., misinterpreting a neutral expression as argumentative) and could lead them to act in ways that surprise or annoy others. To better understand the relationship between irritability and interpersonal functioning, this study investigated whether a frustration manipulation (a proxy for irritability) impaired young adults’ identification of emotions in facial expressions. Subjects were randomly assigned to a frustration or non-frustration condition, after which they were shown short sequences of facial expressions changing from neutral to an emotion. Irritability is expected to impair general emotion recognition, but enhance the perception of anger—similar to adults with high levels of aggression.

However, the relationship between creating imaginary friends as a child and having an interest in fantasy later in development is an open question. Similarly, although having an imaginary friend in early childhood is associated with greater social ability, whether fantasy orientation is related to social ability later in life is unknown. For my thesis, I interviewed adolescents who participated in a study about imaginary friends they had when they were preschoolers. I predicted that the age at which a child created an imaginary friend and family elaboration of the friend would influence whether adolescents remembered their imaginary friend, and that current fantasy orientation would be positively associated with Theory of Mind ability. Results from this project will contribute toward our understanding of the continuity and change in imaginative orientation.

IC complexity is defined by whether the IC interacts only with the child or with additional imagined entities. Previous research has shown that form and relationship type are related, but whether relationship type is related to IC complexity has been relatively unexplored. Therefore, my research investigates whether IC complexity is related to the type of IC relationship. An egalitarian relationship may be more complex than a hierarchical relationship because the child treats the IC as an equal, which theoretically requires more sophisticated social skills on the child’s part. The complexity of ICs will be assessed through parent-completed diaries of children’s ICs and parent and child interviews, which provide information on how children interact with their ICs.",2016,Psychology,Psychology

In the case of the contemporary Russian military, most scholars have attributed success in both Georgia (2008) and Crimea (2014) to a reformed and technologically improved military. Despite a widely accepted “victory” in Georgia, Russia’s military performed disastrously, which catalyzed a series of reforms and modernization projects within the military. Many scholars have traced these reforms to the success of Russia’s operations in Crimea in 2014, citing their superior technology and organizational learning. My thesis addresses the reality of Russia’s military operation in Crimea, which I argue was dependent more on existing social collaborators, intelligence networks, and Russia’s special operations forces, rather than an overwhelming conventional display of military force.

Using case studies and a subnational quantitative analysis of political violence in Africa from 1997-2015, I seek to separate and understand these mechanisms.

An unprecedented increase in violence ensued. Critics have labeled the Mexican government’s strategy ineffective and counterproductive, particularly because of its overreliance on the military and on leadership targeting. Engaging with the debate on the effectiveness of the strategy, I contend with the literature on two points. First, I suggest that a majority of critics fail to take into account the extent to which Mexican institutions suffered from severe corruption when Calderón took office and lack a thorough analysis of alternatives. Second, and most importantly, I question the primary measure that scholars have used to evaluate the success of this strategy—an increase in levels of violence following leadership decapitation—and seek to lay out alternate measures to assess the strategy’s success.",2016,Political Science,Political Science

The impacts of educational gaps affect all of society, as without female doctors, teachers, and policy makers, inequities are perpetuated. Seed Kit (Science Education Equity Development Kit) is a low-cost, reusable, and sustainable lab-in-a-box designed to be used in secondary school classrooms without running water or electricity. The primary focus of Seed Kit is to provide more educational opportunities for the inclusion of women and girls in STEM by providing essential hands-on learning activities in chemistry, biology, and physics to secondary students.",2016,Women's and Gender Studies,Unspecified

For most Americans, civic skills are developed and nurtured in school. But is everyone engaged equally? For our presentation, we will look at inequality in the public school system and and explore the factors that inhibit political participation among Latinx youth.",2016,Political Science,Political Science
3012,2016,Interpersonal Identity and Behavioral Motivations in Monozygotic and Dizygotic Twins,India Kerle,Julie Norem,"This study examined a participant’s degree of interpersonal identity in relation to their friendships, sibling relationships, monozygotic twin relationship, or dizygotic twin relationship. I found that monozygotic twins had a stronger sense of interpersonal identity than any other relationship dyad. I also developed two new relational constructs that were examined within these groups: the “compensatory effect” and the “contrasting effect.” The “compensatory effect” refers to an individual’s motivation to de-identify to the other in the relationship dyad, while the “contrasting effect” refers to an individual’s motivation to protect the other in the relationship dyad. Monozygotic twins demonstrated significantly less compensatory effect than any other relationship dyad. Results were inconclusive regarding the contrasting effect construct. Future studies should develop more reliable motivation measures in monozygotic and dizygotic twin relationship dyads.",2016,Psychology,Psychology
3013,2016,Leadership Camps: Effective Ways to Enact Long-Term Change?,Celeste Glober; India Kerle,Sally Theran,"This past summer, Professor Theran initiated an evaluation of the Girls Leadership Summer Program. The purpose of this project is fully understand the efficacy of this leadership program. Parents and their daughters were surveyed before and after the camp. Girls responded to questions about depression, self-esteem, family bonding, and self-compassion. Parents responded to questionnaires about time spent with their daughters and how they helped their daughters resolve conflict. By analyzing these data, we hope to learn more about the efficacy of this program. In addition to analyzing various psychological measures, we will consider demographic factors that may or may not influence the efficacy of this leadership program.",2016,Psychology,Psychology
3014,2016,"Shyness, Love-Shyness, and Individual Differences in Sexual Attitudes and Behavior",Alyson Randall,Jonathan Cheek,"Shyness is the tendency to feel tense, worried, or awkward during social interactions, especially with unfamiliar people. The term “love-shyness” was coined by Gilmartin in 1987 to describe the relatively small percentage of American heterosexual men who are single and never married, not by choice, but because of their shyness. Based on his interpretations of American gender roles, Gilmartin believed that love-shyness was predominantly a male phenomenon. However, his argument that love-shyness does not affect women lacked empirical support. For example, Wilson (1958) found that the majority of 500 unmarried women listed shyness as their main barrier to marriage. Since Gilmartin, there has been limited research on shyness and sexuality. Therefore, the purpose of my research is to examine gender differences within the relationship between shyness and sexual attitudes and behaviors. In this presentation, results of this study will be discussed, along with limitations and conclusions.",2016,Psychology,Psychology
3015,2016,Mind-Wandering Tendencies in Younger Adults,Anissa Sridhar; Hannah Creutzfeldt,Joseph Keller,"Mind wandering has been the term used to describe when you are not paying attention to the task at hand. Our project has studied how individual differences in the brain contribute to mind-wandering tendencies in younger (20- to 30-year-old) adults. Mindfulness, which is considered the opposite of mind wandering, has been shown to correlate with higher attention and focus and reduce task-unrelated thoughts. We have used cognitive assessments to determine individual levels of mindfulness and to assess certain cognitive abilities. We are using the Sustained Attention Response Task (SART) in coordination with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to not only determine what differences can be seen on SART performance and task-unrelated thoughts but also what parts of the brain are activated when those thoughts occur. Our results should give further insight into the neural correlates of focus and attention, which is important in everyday life.",,Neuroscience,Brain and Cognitive Sciences
