0,"Recent surveys indicate that alcohol abuse among women is rising, of which a particularly noxious form is drinking during pregnancy. Mandated beneï¬Åts for alcohol and substance abuse treatment have the potential to counter this behavior, by requiring through state law that insurance companies provide more generous ï¬Ånancial or medical coverage for these services. My analysis measures the eï¬€ect of having alcohol and substance abuse mandated beneï¬Åts within a state on a spectrum of infant health indicators, including Apgar scores, infant mortality, congenital defects, period of gestation, and birth weight.","ADVISOR: Courtney Coile, Economics",Economics,Economics and Mathematics,2010,Lisa Abraham,The Effect of Mandated Beneï¬Åts for Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment on Infant Health Outcomes,2010
1,"Pregnant women with access to modern standards of prenatal and perinatal care are subject to a variety of screenings and procedures that are designed to improve the health of both mother and infant. These â€œinterventionsâ€ù tend to increase with maternal age, as older mothers face greater health risks that may be prevented with appropriate use of obstetric intervention. However, since mothers aged 35 and older are deemed to have reached â€œadvanced maternal ageâ€ù, interventions are performed at a more aggressive rate, creating a jump, or discontinuity, of the rate of obstetric intervention at age 35 that may be due to non-medical reasons.  This study takes advantage of such discontinuity in order to measure the eï¬€ectiveness of various obstetric procedures in improving infant health. Examined procedures include the performance of cesarean section deliveries and induction of birth, the use of electric fetal monitoring, and the implementation of amniocentesis.","ADVISOR: Kristin Butcher, Economics",Economics,Economics,2010,Runshan Deng,Does Obstetric Intervention Improve Infant Health?

2,"One signiï¬Åcant source of the increased spending on health care in the United States is the escalating costliness and prevalence  of diabetes. Diabetes is extremely expensive due to complications that can result and the need for medication and health checks throughout a lifetime. The costs related to diabetes are not conï¬Åned to the aï¬„icted individual, but extend to society as a whole through higher taxes, elevated insurance premiums, and reduced standards of living. Given the increasing prevalence and importance of diabetes, this paper focuses on the role of preventative care in the successful treatment of diabetes. This paper investigates whether health insurance aï¬€ects diabeticsâ€™ usage of preventative care and also measures the eï¬€ects on health outcomes for diabetics. The analysis uses a regression discontinuity model and the discrete change in eligibility for Medicare once Americans turn 65 to measure these eï¬€ects.","ADVISOR: Robin McKnight, Economics",Economics,Economics,2010,Ilana Orloff,Does Accessible Health Care Make a Difference?

3,"As the U.S. moves closer to adopting universal health insurance coverage, one critical question is how health insurance coverage aï¬€ects the utilization of health care services and health outcomes. This eï¬€ect is diï¬ƒcult to identify, since people with and without health insurance may diï¬€er in ways that aï¬€ect these outcomesâ€”for example, people who are sick may be more likely to buy insurance. New cancer diagnoses, which serve as a shock to an individualâ€™s health status, oï¬€er a potentially appealing way to identify the eï¬€ect of insurance on utilization and outcomes. In this project, I use the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database to explore whether health insurance coverage aï¬€ects cancer treatment and mortality. Controlling for the severity of cancer and other predictors of mortality, I compare patient outcomes by age and race, looking carefully at how these change at the Medicare eligibility age of 65.","ADVISOR: Courtney Coile, Economics",Economics,Economics,2010,Susun Kim,Does Health Insurance Affect Utilization of Health Services and Health Outcomes?

4,"In the Victorian Era, â€œhysteriaâ€ù was a common diagnosis that often conï¬Åned women to bed for weeks on end. The theorized root of the disease was the inherent frailty of women: too much strenuous activity was thought to cause a host of ailments, from anxiety and sleeplessness to delirium, to vaginal lubrication and other signs of sexual arousal. The diagnosis pathologized sexual desire in women, and treatment often included isolation or sexual violation. Even the threat of diagnosis was enough to enforce the Victorian ideal of female passivity by deï¬Åning inappropriate behavior. The concept of hysteria was so fraught with gender stereotypes that it crossed the line from a true medical condition to a tool doctors used to forcibly control womenâ€™s bodies. By placing severe limitations on women as a sex, the hysteria diagnosis reinforced Victorian social norms and helped to keep women intellectually, sexually, and socially subordinate to men.","ADVISOR: Charlene Galarneau, Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies",Womenâ€™s and Gender Studies,Unspecified,2013,Megan Wilson,Hysteria: Victorian Violence Against Women,2010
5,"Is a whale a ï¬Åsh? Biblical references, economic interests, and common sense in the early nineteenth century thought so, and scientiï¬Åc authorities were powerless to sway popular opinion. The barrier between the scientiï¬Åc community and lay audience has been in place since people ï¬Årst tried to share observations with those around them. A journal article written for an audience of experts is meaningless and impenetrable to the average reader even if they ï¬Ånd interest in the subject, so science writers must present scientiï¬Åc information in a familiar, almost narrative style. Successful writers must be  able to evaluate the popular attitude regarding academic authority to avoid alienating audience members while maintaining scientiï¬Åc integrity.

To what extent did satirical prints not simply reï¬‚ect but actually reform the medical marketplace? What role did popular art play in re-shaping the doctor-patient relationship, the practice of medicine and hygiene, and the rise of hospitals and other medical institutions?

9,"Referential shift is a grammatical device used to mark multiple perspectives in a narrative. Across diï¬€erent sign languages, signers shift their torso to one side or the other to express referential shift. Although the body shift ironically depicts a character shift, it depends on the signer consistently placing characters in the same space across a narrative. We examined whether signers of an emerging sign language in Nicaragua use the body shift as a referential shift device. In the Nicaraguan deaf community, the younger signers introduce grammatical features that the older signers are unable to acquire. Deaf Nicaraguansâ€™ descriptions of six videos were coded for consistency in marking spatial relations and for the use of the body shift. Younger signers used the body shift and consistently marked spatial relations more often than older signers. Thus, the use of the body shift only emerges when signers consistently locate characters in space.

10,"People often gesture while talking. But does gesture make talking easier? Previously, we demonstrated that some individuals show enhanced word retrieval while gesturing. The current within-subjects study examined the interaction between working memory and gesture in word retrieval. Thirty-eight monolinguals completed two working memory tasks and named two sets of pictures. For one set, participants were allowed to gesture (GA); for the other their gestures were inhibited (GI). There were no diï¬€erences between the GA and GI conditions in the number of successfully retrieved words. But the ability to successfully resolve a tip-of-the-tongue state (ToT) while in the GI condition positively correlated with auditory working memory, but not spatial working memory; individuals with poorer auditory working memory relied on gestures to help them resolve their ToTs. These results indicate that gesture plays a role in language production, but only for those whose auditory working span cannot support rapid word retrieval.

11,"The current study examines how signers of American Sign Language (ASL) prefer to describe spatial relations. ASL can convey spatial relations in two ways. First, ASL has spatial prepositions like ON and UNDER. Alternatively, signers can use classifier constructions to iconically describe spatial relations. To sign, â€œthe cup is on the table,â€ù the signer places one hand representing the cup on the other hand representing the table. To depict â€œthe cup is under the tableâ€ù the signer moves the â€œcupâ€ù hand under the â€œtable hand.â€ù Thirty-one native signersâ€™ descriptions of 77 short videos depicting spatial relations were coded for whether prepositions, classiï¬Åer constructions, or both were used. ASL signers overwhelmingly preferred to use classiï¬Åer constructions (93%) over prepositions (.02%). Sometimes they used a combination of both (6%). The preference for classiï¬Åers likely stems from the fact that they simultaneously express object and spatial information, while prepositions only express the latter.

12,"Since its discovery in 1981, AIDS has killed more than 25 million people. In 2005 alone, there were 4.1 million new HIV-1 infections and 2.8 million AIDS deaths. Currently, antiretroviral treatment is the best option for long-lasting viral suppression and reduction of morbidity and mortality. Our current research focuses on APOBEC3G, a human protein, that is an attractive lead for treatment. APOBEC3G interferes with HIV replication by inducing many deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine mutations on HIV DNA as the virus replicates via reverse transcription. Unfortunately, lentiviruses, such as HIV, have evolved the Viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein in order to counteract this eï¬€ect by triggering ubiquitination and degradation of APBOEC3G via the proteasomal pathway. In order to study the APOBEC3G/Vif relationship, a Tetracycline-responsive system and Ecdysone-inducible promoter system was designed. This cell line would help determine the eï¬€ect of diï¬€erent APOBEC3 cytidine deaminase expression levels on HIV and its diversiï¬Åcation.","ADVISOR: Donald Elmore, Chemistry",Chemistry,Biochemistry,2011,Jenny Chang,Designing an Inducible APOBEC3G Cell Line to Combat HIV,2010
13,"The ovarian steroid hormone, progesterone, acts in the brain to profoundly inï¬‚uence a variety of physiological processes and behaviors, including development, reproduction, and cognition. Progesterone elicits many of these biological eï¬€ects by binding to progestin receptors (PR), which are a member of a superfamily of nuclear transcriptional activators. PR are expressed in two forms, full length PR-B and truncated PR-A, that are transcribed from the same gene. With the recent advancement in powerful genetic approaches to manipulate and examine the mouse genome and proteome, the mouse model provides a sophisticated experimental model for studying mechanisms of progesterone action in brain. In this study, a mouse-on-mouse pull-down assay was developed to examine the physical interactions between GST-tagged mouse PR subtypes and coactivators from mouse brain. By taking a proteomic-based approach, we hope to identify other coactivators and potentially novel proteins that physically interact with PR subtypes to mediate progesterone action in the brain.","ADVISOR: Marc Tetel, Neuroscience",Neuroscience,"Neuroscience, Biological Chemistry","2010, 2012","DaEun (Dana) Im, Jennifer Wan",Understanding Hormone Actions in the Brain: Interactions between Mouse Progestin Receptor Subtypes and Steroid Receptor Coactivators,2010

15,"Molting, or the shedding of the epidermis, is crucial to insect growth and development. Although the mechanism underlying the secretion of the molting hormone, ecdysone, is known, the factors regulating its expression and the timing of the molt remain poorly understood. To examine whether certain nutrients obtained from diets are responsible for the initiation of the molt, fourth instar Manduca sexta larvae were fed diets of varied nutrient concentrations and composition until they molted. Results showed a direct correlation between the amount of protein intake and the duration of molting. Sucrose, however, failed to induce a molt. Amino acids, coupled with TOR signaling therefore may play a key role in regulating the molting process.

Yet the mechanism underlying phenotypic plasticity is not well understood. To begin to investigate the regulation of phenotypic plasticity in abdominal pigmentation of the milkweed bug, Oncopeltus fasciatus, the roles of Hox genes were investigated. The knockdown of Abd-B Hox gene expression through RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in increased abdominal pigmentation, indicating that Abd-B likely plays a repressive role in the temperature sensitive regulation of abdominal coloration. Furthermore, bugs injected with Abd-A double-stranded RNA developed into adults that completely lacked abdominal pigmentation, indicating that Abd-A most likely plays an important role in the generation of the black pattern.

One gene implicated in the temporal organization of development encodes for the transcriptional regulator Abrupt. Much of what is known about its role comes from Drosophila studies: repression of Abrupt in ï¬‚y abdominal muscles during pupal development prevents progression to the adult stage, and Abrupt may temporally regulate border cell motility through ecdysone signaling in ï¬‚y ovaries. To examine the evolutionary conservation of the function of this gene, the eï¬€ect of removal of Abrupt was examined in the beetle Tribolium casteneum using RNA interference (RNAi).

These two groups occupy two diï¬€erent sections of history and humanity, but they share membership in the world of the subaltern and a struggle to (re)gain their voices. Writers of this literature had various motives and messages, but all contributed to a legacy that still remains today. What about this literature is problematic for the aforementioned groups? What challenges do they face by being part of a history and discourse that they had little to no hand in writing?","ADVISOR: Elena GascÃ_n-Vera, Spanish",Spanish,Spanish,2010,Zahra Mohamed,"Two Worlds, One Subaltern: Oppression of the Subaltern in Spanish Medieval and Colonial Literature",2010

As a result, developing nations must extend education, especially primary education, to their entire populations in order to fully capitalize on opportunities brought to their countries through increased international trade and ï¬Ånancial integration. This presentation will discuss education as a public good and analyze the role of the public sector in providing education. Economists agree that education improves social welfare universally through increased positive returns to wage earners; still, some wonder whether the externalities from schooling truly justify full government subsidies. In addition to exploring supply-side interventions, like the construction of new schools, and demand-side interventions, like voucher programs, the presentation will consider the cost-eï¬€ectiveness of these initiatives, especially in developing nations, and question the validity of education as a global public good.","ADVISOR: Joseph P.

Using cost-beneï¬Åt analysis, we will evaluate four methods to prevent ï¬Ånancial instabilityâ€”re-regulation of ï¬Ånancial markets, capital controls, adopting a global common currency and creating special bond markets for debt denominated in currencies of emerging markets. The results of the analysis have profound policy implications for the World Bank, the IMF and governments worldwide to better manage ï¬Ånancial instability.","ADVISOR: Joseph P.

64,"Since September 11, 2001, the idea of terrorism has become a part of our national dialogue and daily lives. Our presentation seeks to examine the costs and beneï¬Åts of potential solutions to this global problem. Unlike some other global crises,  transnational terrorism kills relatively few people every year, yet the fear of an attack is pervasive. Consequently governments pour millions of dollars into anti-terrorism campaigns. Terrorism is not often examined from an economic perspective and many of these solutions are not cost eï¬ƒcient. In  our presentation we will illustrate the diï¬ƒculties in ï¬Ånding a cost eï¬ƒcient and politically viable solution.","ADVISOR: Joseph P.

65,"Since the onset of the era of ï¬Ånancial globalization, emerging market economies have sharply increased their holding of inter-national reserves, from approximately 8% of their GDP in 1990 to almost 30% of GDP in recent years. One popular explanation for this development is that reserves can serve as a self-insurance tool to insulate domestic economies from foreign adverse shocks. As economies have become more ï¬Ånancially integrated, the potential for sudden reversals in capital ï¬‚ows and the international transmission of ï¬Ånancial stress has increased as well. Therefore, it is especially important to assess the eï¬€ectiveness of reserves as a self-insurance policy tool. This study empirically investigates whether countries with higher levels of reserve assets were able to better withstand the shock from the U.S. subprime crisis. Speciï¬Åcally, we use sovereign credit default swaps (CDS) as an indicator of ï¬Ånancial vulnerability and analyze the relationship between CDS spread movements and reserve accumulation.","ADVISOR: Joseph P.

Critics of these enterprises claimed that they were created and owned by wealthy elite, and served interests that were â€œodious to the people.â€ù But little is known about who actually owned shares in early corporations. Using lists of corporate shareholders collected from capital taxes imposed on corporations in New York, which were matched to early property tax records, I compare the wealth and status of those who owned stock in corporations to the general population both in 1791, when there were only two corporations in the state, and in 1826, when there were hundreds.

Testosterone production in the testes is regulated by a well-established pathway, including positive and negative feedback within the pituitary and hypothalamus. However, other enzymes located in the testes may also regulate this pathway. One such enzyme is thimet oligopeptidase (TOP), an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes short peptides. TOP is found throughout the body, but is most catalytically active in the testes and brain. We hypothesized that changes in TOP activity could aï¬€ect the production of testosterone. Our experiments showed that a speciï¬Åc TOP inhibitor aï¬€ected circulating testosterone concentrations in male mice, as well as TOP activity in the testes and brain.

80,hN1LNRA is the ï¬Årst of the three tandem Lin12/Notch Repeats in the human Notch1 receptor that regulates cell fate decisions.

96,"Concern over Pb, Zn, and Cd contamination downstream of the Tar Creek Superfund Site, a former mining district in Oklahoma, has prompted investigation into the role of hydrous ferric oxides (HFOs) in metal adsorption and transport. The two primary metal sources to Tar Creekâ€”seepage of groundwater from mines and run-oï¬€ from mine waste pilesâ€”result in the formation of two distinct HFO types that mix with creek sediment to form a third composite type observed at downstream locations. This project characterized the chemical and physical properties of each HFO type and quantiï¬Åed metal associations by mineral phase. Metal concentrations and Pb/Zn ratios decrease away from the source, suggesting that metal aï¬ƒnity for HFOs relates to sorption stability constants. Changes in HFO composition and morphology following mixing with creek sediment and deposition on downstream ï¬‚oodplains could aï¬€ect the potential for metal remobilization.

Increase in high skilled exports increase returns to education and can inï¬‚uence parents to substitute child labor for schooling. However, if parents send their children to work out of necessity or poverty, they will be present-biased and expectations of future income may not aï¬€ect child labor. In theory, increase in low skilled exports both raises household income and child wages with ambiguous eï¬€ects on child labor.

Contraceptives have a two-fold purposeâ€” to limit births and to delay births. As female sterilization is an irreversible procedure, it can only be used to limit births. For this reason one would expect women to use spacing mechanisms in addition to sterilization. But very few Indian women do.

128,"Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder that aï¬€ects about 1.1% of the adult U.S. population. Glutamate carboxypeptidase (GCPII) deï¬Åcient mice exhibit several of the symptoms of schizophrenia and contain a genetic mutation that results in decreased levels of GCPII, an enzyme that hydrolyzes N-acetyl-aspartate glutamate into N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and glutamate(glu). We thus hypothesize that the mutant mice will have lower levels of glutamate than wild-type mice. The non-invasive techniques of magnetic resonance spectroscopy and imaging (MRS and MRI) yield useful results in neurochemical studies of GCPII mice. Chemical analysis using MRS both in vivo and ex vivo focuses on the levels of NAA, glu, and glutamine in the brain. In addition, brain structure volumes were examined using MRI. By determining concentrations of these metabolites in the brain as well as structural characteristics, diï¬€erences between wild type and mutant mice were investigated.

Yet, why these trends continue or what people of marriageable age think about these phenomena remains under explored. In my thesis I study college-aged women and their expectations for their future relationships. My working hypothesis has been that children of divorce, regardless of their socioeconomic background, are more likely to have polarized expectations regarding their relationships: they are more likely to be completely commitment-averse or commitment-demanding; they are more likely to have thought about divorce in their futures (either as a deï¬Ånite occurrence or a complete impossibility); they are less likely to believe in â€œthe oneâ€ù (i.e, a soul mate); and they are more likely to expect a partner to break oï¬€ a relationship unless they are shown complete and absolute devotion. Early analysis of focus group data with 29 womenâ€”10 whose parents are divorce, 10 who identify their parents as happily married, and 9 who identify their parents as unhappily marriedâ€”reveals that women whose parents are unhappily married or divorced have more clearly deï¬Åned future plans and are more pessimistic about eventually ï¬Ånding someone with whom they can spend their entire lives. They also tend to be more aware of their parentâ€™s relationships and see their parents as an example for their own relationships.

160,"Japanese society is built around a strict adherence to the ideal of normality: school, work, marriage and family. Lesbianism is considered a lifestyle choice that is deviant from the norm and thus is rendered invisible by a widespread social silencing. The ï¬Årst woman to publicly come out, Hiroko Kakefuda, challenged the community to â€œreclaim the word â€˜lesbianâ€™â€ù and assert their space in society. In response to her challenge, lesbian activists within the last decade have taken an education-focused approach in their pursuit of social acceptance. They are amending the standard for what is normal to be inclusive of lesbian individuals through redeï¬Åning of terminology, creating new images of the lesbian experience, and drawing on reestablished institutions to promote an â€˜ideal Japan.â€™  By adopting the rhetoric of â€˜normalityâ€™ to legitimize the lesbian experience, lesbian activists are changing the notion of sexuality in Japan.

161,"Suppose a police oï¬ƒcer pulls over a driver and asks, â€œCan I look inside your trunk?â€ù Although the oï¬ƒcerâ€™s question is a request that can be refused, I argue that there are compelling reasons to believe that drivers often interpret such questions as orders that must be obeyed. Moreover, I argue that when drivers take such an utterance to be an order, the driverâ€™s aï¬ƒrmative response does not constitute consent, and thus the subsequent search by the police oï¬ƒcer is unconstitutional. I also explore the possibility that there are racial and socioeconomic injustices involved and I critically evaluate several potential solutions to this problem.","ADVISOR: Mary Kate McGowan, Philosophy",Philosophy,Philosophy  and Architecture,2010,Shan Shan Tam,Are Consensual Searches Really Consensual?,2010
162,"How important are signiï¬Åcant others to our goals? Relationships with romantic others and close friends have been shown to impact how an individual views themselves, others, and the environment. Close others have also been shown to impact goal pursuits positively and negatively. This presentation will discuss my study on the relationships among goals, close relationships, and relational identity orientation. For this study, college undergraduates and faculty completed ï¬Åve questionnaires that measured how much romantic others and close friends helped or inï¬‚uenced goals, the importance of achievement goals, relationship closeness, and the subjective importance of social relationships. Understanding the importance of close friends and romantic partners in our lives can help us gain a fuller picture of how this aspect of the self is impacted by interpersonal relations. This presentation will further discuss the constructs mentioned above and the results of the study.","ADVISOR: Julie Norem, Psychology",Psychology,Psychology,2011,Krista Olson,"Goals, Close Relationships, and the Self",2010

In particular, the adoption of Western cultural standards may result in disturbance of body image among Asian women because of physical disparities between them and their white counterparts. We investigated diï¬€erences in satisfaction with ethnically salient body features among Euro, Chinese, and Korean American college women. In addition to investigating ethnic variability in body image, we ascertained whether these diï¬€erences were related to the use of plastic surgery, ethnic identiï¬Åcation, individualism/collectivism, and social class.

164,"Beginning on the First Sunday in Advent in 1964, the Catholic Mass underwent a  transformation from the traditional, sacred Latin to what some would call the â€œheavenly  hootenanny.â€ù In addition to the most obvious changes in the Mass, Vatican II brought about many other changes in the Catholic Church. Lay people were expected to take an active role in the Church rather than being passive recipients of the sacraments; sacramentals, religious devotions, and even some saints were no longer considered as integral. These changes greatly impacted Catholics and their beliefs. I will discuss what I learned through my independent study in the  religion department about these changes,  as set out by Vatican II and as interpreted by various segments of the Church, and  consider their impact on Catholics and the Catholic Church.","ADVISOR: Sharon Elkins, Religion",Religion,American Studies and Peace and Justice Studies,2010,Abigail Friedman,The Heavenly Hootenanny and Other Changes to the Catholic Church from Vatican II,2010
165,"During the twentieth century, in tandem with an overall trend toward secularization in American society, religion lost its place in the public school curriculum. Today, in the face of signiï¬Åcant conï¬‚icts around the world based on clashes between religious ideologies, American high schools no longer teach basic facts about the worldâ€™s religions. State curriculum standards typically do not address religion and pressure often falls on individual teachers to determine how to incorporate religion into their lessons. In the absence of oï¬ƒcial curriculum standards, when such instruction takes place, it is ad hoc and often dependent on teachersâ€™ informal knowledge of religious pluralism. Surveying both public and private high school teachers, I will explore how teachers are prepared to teach religion and how they actually present it in the classroom. Understanding the condition of instruction about religion in the secondary school classroom is the ï¬Årst step towards imagining a more balanced curriculum.","ADVISOR: Ed Silver, Religion",Religion,Sociology,2010,Kate Soules,The Elusive Fourth R:  Religion in the Secondary School Social Studies Curriculum,2010
166,"The Ambedkar conversion movement, which began in 1956, has seen generations of Hindu Untouchables convert to Buddhism. Drawing upon interviews conducted in the converted community over two research trips to Nagpur, India, I have examined the evolution of the Ambedkar Buddhist movement as a process that is characterized by stages of change over time. In my research, I have observed the ways in which conversion is an ongoing process through the convertsâ€™ acceptance of the Triratna, or Three Jewelsâ€”the Buddha, Dhamma (teachings of the Buddha), and Sangha (Buddhist community). Following the common understanding that taking refuge in the Triratna oï¬ƒcially makes one â€œBuddhist,â€ù I explore how the level of acceptance inï¬‚uences a convertâ€™s growing sense of identity as Buddhist. I also explore how the converts both rely on and reject their prior identity as Hindus at diï¬€erent stages, thus carving a new identity from the dynamics of multiple religious identities.","ADVISOR: Neelima Shukla-Bhatt, South Asia Studies",South Asia Studies,Religion and Sociology,2010,Claire Droste,Becoming More Buddhist over Time: An Analysis of the Ambedkar Conversion Movement in India,2010
167,"As a womenâ€™s college, Wellesley is seen as a shining example of womenâ€™s power and progress. It is implicitly feminist with its â€œwomen who willâ€ù mission statement. Yet on many levels Wellesley straddles the fence as a feminist institution, exhibiting various models of inclusion and exclusion. In political theory, the dominant understanding of power is â€œpower over,â€ù in which domination and control are key. Feminist political theorists argue an alternative deï¬Ånition of power: â€œpower to.â€ù Drawing on these two theories of dominant and feminist expressions of power, I will discuss the power dynamics of various Wellesley students, faculty, and staï¬€ and attempt to analyze the extent to which Wellesley perpetuates and challenges the dominant understanding of power today.","ADVISOR: Roxanne Euben, Political Science",Political Science,Political Science  and Economics,2010,Katherine Chanpong,Path to (Em)Power: The Politics and Purpose of Wellesley College,2010
168,"For incoming undergraduates, college represents an important but often challenging transition. Students go through a period of adjustment as they acquire new skills and knowledge necessary for navigating the academic and social landscapes of the campus. Researchers have found that initial experiences on the ï¬Årst year strongly contribute to a long term â€œsense of belongingâ€ù and success in college (Hurtado & Carter 1997). However, studies also reveal that for many Latino/a students, the transition to college is especially diï¬ƒcult. In my senior thesis, I analyze ï¬Årst and second year interviews with 60 students participating in a longitudinal study of the Class of 2010. I focus my attention on the transition experiences of Latino/a and White students. I speciï¬Åcally explore how studentsâ€™ relationships with faculty, friends, and family aï¬€ect the college transition process. My study will potentially illuminate how colleges can best intervene to help students overcome pre-college disadvantages and achieve more positive academic and social outcomes.","ADVISOR: Joe Swingle, Sociology",Sociology,Sociology and Spanish,2010,Evgenia â€œZhenyaâ€ù Karelina,Factors Inï¬‚uencing College Transition and Sense of Belonging in Latina/o Students,2010
169,"A number of researchers have examined the determinants of alumni donations, many motivated by concern for the ï¬Ånancial stability of higher education institutions.  In contrast, Meer and Rosen (2009) marry  a study of altruistic giving with higher education ï¬Ånance, using institutional data  to disentangle the relative importance of selï¬Åshness and altruism as determinants of alumni giving. The research presented here addresses the same question asked by Meer and Rosen: whether donations to oneâ€™s alma mater are motivated by altruistic factors or  by the desire to increase childrenâ€™s probability of admission. Data from a single-sex institution, however, provides a natural control group, allowing the same estimation to be made more precisely and with less risk of endogeneity. Using giving data from Wellesley College, we ï¬Ånd evidence that donations by Wellesley alumnae are indeed tied to the college admissions timeline.","ADVISOR: Patrick J.

170,"The name and writings of Shakespeare carry with them considerable power. From the late eighteenth century on, women have appropriated his cultural authority to give credence to their otherwise unconventional roles as scholars, critics, and public performers, asserting a uniquely female intuitive and emotional connection to the Bard. This gendered approach allowed them to enter into competition with their male counterparts and to raise serious social and political questions; however, it sometimes came dangerously close to reaï¬ƒrming the essentialist stereotypes that limited womenâ€™s power and authority in the real world. Wellesley College, from its founding a remarkable community of female Shakespeare scholars, soon became a site of tension between essentialism and experimentation as the students of the Shakespeare Society clashed with professors and administrators over the extent and nature of its dramatic performances, in which young women adopted male dress and manners.","ADVISOR: William E.
